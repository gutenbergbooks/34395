<br /><i>LOST ON A HILLTOP</i></h2>
<p>The little iceboat, with two laughing, shouting
girls clinging to it, sped over the frozen surface of
Big Bear River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, we&rsquo;re going too fast!&rdquo; screamed Louise
Sidell, ducking to protect her face from the biting
wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only about forty an hour!&rdquo; shrieked her companion
gleefully.</p>
<p>At the tiller of the <i>Icicle</i>, Penelope Parker, in fur-lined
parka, sheepskin coat and goggles, looked for
all the world like a jolly Eskimo. Always delighting
in a new sport, she had built the iceboat herself&mdash;spars
from a wood lot, the sail from an old tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow down, Penny!&rdquo; pleaded her chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; shouted Penny cheerfully. &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re going
into a hike!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>As one runner raised off the ice, the boat tilted far
over on its side. Louise shrieked with terror, and held
tight to prevent being thrown out. Penny, hard
pressed, sought to avert disaster by a snappy starting
of the main sheet.</p>
<p>For a space the boat rushed on, runners roaring.
Then as a sudden puff of wind struck the sail, the
steering runner leaped off the ice. Instantly the <i>Icicle</i>
went into a spin from which Penny could not
straighten it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going over!&rdquo; screamed Louise, scrambling
to free her feet.</p>
<p>The next moment the boat capsized. Both girls
went sliding on their backs across the ice. Penny
landed in a snowdrift at the river bank, her parka
awry, goggles hanging on one ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Lou?&rdquo; she called, jumping to her
feet.</p>
<p>Louise sprawled on the ice some distance away.
Slowly she pulled herself to a sitting position and
rubbed the back of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this is your idea of fun!&rdquo; she complained.
&ldquo;As for me, give me bronco busting! It would be a
mild sport in comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny chuckled, dusting snow from her clothing.
&ldquo;Why, this is fun, Lou. We have to expect these little
upsets while we&rsquo;re learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sail of the overturned iceboat was billowing
like a parachute. Slipping and sliding, Penny ran to
pull it in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take the old thing down!&rdquo; urged Louise, hobbling
after her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough ice-boating for this afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just one more turn down the river and back,&rdquo;
coaxed Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! We&rsquo;re close to the club house now. If we
sail off again, there&rsquo;s no telling where we&rsquo;ll land.
Anyway, it&rsquo;s late and it&rsquo;s starting to snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny reluctantly acknowledged that Louise spoke
pearls of wisdom. Large, damp snowflakes were
drifting down, dotting her red mittens. The wind
steadily was stiffening, and cold penetrated her sheepskin
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be dark within an hour,&rdquo; added Louise.
Uneasily she scanned the leaden sky. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been
out here all afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it is time to go home,&rdquo; admitted Penny.
&ldquo;Oh, well, it won&rsquo;t take us long to get the <i>Icicle</i>
loaded onto the car trailer. Lucky we upset so close
to the club house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Setting to work with a will, the girls took down the
flapping sail. After much tugging and pushing, they
righted the boat and pulled it toward the Riverview
Yacht Club. Closed for the winter, the building
looked cold and forlorn. Penny, however, had left
her car in the snowy parking lot, which was convenient
to the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we could get warm somewhere,&rdquo; Louise
said, shivering. &ldquo;It must be ten below zero.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Pulling the <i>Icicle</i> behind them, the girls climbed
the slippery river bank. Snow now swirled in clouds,
half-curtaining the club house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the car and drive it down here,&rdquo; Penny offered,
starting toward the parking lot. &ldquo;No use dragging
the boat any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abandoning the <i>Icicle</i>, Louise went with her chum.
A dozen steps took the girls to a wind-swept corner of
the deserted building. Rounding it, they both stopped
short, staring.</p>
<p>On the snow-banked parking lot where the car had
been left, there now stood only one vehicle, an unpainted,
two-wheel trailer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great fishes!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the
coupe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you forgot to set the brake and it rolled
into a ditch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, the trailer would have gone with it.&rdquo;
Her face grim, Penny ran on toward the parking lot.</p>
<p>Reaching the trailer, the girls saw by tire tracks in
the snow that the car had been detached and driven
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it! I knew it!&rdquo; Penny wailed, pounding
her mittens together. &ldquo;The coupe&rsquo;s been stolen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that across the road?&rdquo; Louise demanded.
&ldquo;It looks like an automobile to me. In the ditch,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Taking new hope, Penny went to investigate the
little ravine. Through a screen of bare tree branches
and bushes, she glimpsed a blur of metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the car!&rdquo; she cried jubilantly. &ldquo;But how did
it get across the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s elation quickly died. Drawing nearer, she
was dismayed to see that the coupe appeared to be
lying on its stomach in the ditch. Four wheels and
a spare had been removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stripped of every tire!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The thief
ran the car out here on the road so we couldn&rsquo;t see
him at work from the river!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; Louise asked weakly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re miles from Riverview. No houses close by.
We&rsquo;re half frozen and night is coming on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, her face very long, had no answer. She
measured the gasoline tank with a stick. All of the
fuel had been siphoned. She lifted the hood, expecting
to find vital parts of the engine missing. However,
everything appeared to be in place.</p>
<p>Seeking protection from the penetrating wind, the
girls climbed into the car to discuss their situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we just wait here until someone comes along
and gives us a lift to town?&rdquo; suggested Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we&rsquo;re on a side road and few cars travel
this way during winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not go somewhere and telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest stores are at Kamm&rsquo;s corner, about
two miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Louise gazed thoughtfully at the soft snow which
was banking deeper on the windshield of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two miles in this, facing the wind, will be a hard
hike. Think we ought to try it, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to. And we needn&rsquo;t either!
Do you remember Salt Sommers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The photographer who works on your father&rsquo;s
newspaper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he spends his spare time as an airplane spotter.
His station is over in the hills not more than a half
mile from here! Why not tramp over there and ask
him to telephone our folks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you know the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was there once last summer,&rdquo; Penny said confidently.
&ldquo;One follows a side road through the woods.
I&rsquo;m sure I can find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Louise consented, sliding from behind
the steering wheel. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going, let&rsquo;s move right
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stiff with cold, the girls trudged past the club house
and on down the road. Snow was falling faster and
faster. Several times they paused to wipe their frosted
goggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This promises to be a man-sized blizzard,&rdquo; Louise
observed uneasily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting dark early, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Penny nodded, her thoughts on what she would
say to her father when she reached home. The car
had been fully insured, but even so it would not be
easy to replace five stolen tires. Ruefully she reflected
that Mrs. Weems, the kindly housekeeper who had
looked after her since her mother&rsquo;s death, had not
favored the river trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t take it so hard,&rdquo; Louise tried to cheer
her. &ldquo;Maybe the thief will be caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance of it,&rdquo; Penny responded gloomily.</p>
<p>A hundred yards farther on the girls came to another
side road which wound upward through the
wooded hills. Already there was an ominous dusk
settling over the valley. Penny paused to take bearings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this is the way,&rdquo; she said doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m pretty sure,&rdquo; Penny amended. &ldquo;Salt&rsquo;s
station is up there on top of one of those hills. If this
snow would stop we should be able to see the tower
from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slightly reassured, Louise followed her chum across
a wooden bridge and up a narrow, winding road. On
either side of the frozen ditches, tall frosted evergreens
provided friendly protection from the stabbing, icy
wind. Nevertheless, walking was not easy for the
roadbed bore a shell of treacherous ice.</p>
<p>Confident that they soon would come to the airplane
listening post, the girls trudged on. Penny,
anxious to make the most of the remaining daylight,
set a stiff pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we be coming to the station?&rdquo; Louise
presently asked. &ldquo;Surely we&rsquo;ve gone more than a
half mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The post is a little ways off from the road,&rdquo; Penny
confessed, peering anxiously at the unbroken line of
evergreens. &ldquo;We should be able to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this blinding snow? Why, we may have passed
the station without knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not one bit sure, Penny Parker!&rdquo; Louise
accused. &ldquo;We were crazy to start off without being
certain of the post&rsquo;s location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always can go back to the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly frozen now,&rdquo; Louise complained, slapping
her mittens together. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no feeling in one
of my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny paused to wipe the moisture from her goggles.
From far down the road came the sound of a
laboring motor. She listened hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A car, Lou!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Everything will be all
right now! We&rsquo;ll hail it and ask the driver for a lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly encouraged, the girls waited for the approaching
vehicle. They could hear it climbing a
steep knoll, then descending. From the sound of the
engine they decided that it must be a truck and that
it might round the curve at a fast speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Worried lest the driver fail to see them, the girls
stepped out into the middle of the road. As the truck
swerved around the bend, they shouted and waved
their arms.</p>
<p>The startled driver slammed on brakes, causing the
big black truck to slide like a sled. Penny and Louise
leaped aside, barely avoiding being struck.</p>
<p>As they watched anxiously, the driver recovered
control of the machine. He straightened out and
brought the truck to a standstill farther up the road.</p>
<p>Penny seized her chum&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Come on, Lou!
He&rsquo;s going to give us a ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they could reach the truck, the driver lowered
the cab window. Thrusting his head through
the opening he bellowed angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you tryin&rsquo; to do? Wreck my truck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giving the girls no opportunity to reply, he closed
the cab window.</p>
<p>Penny saw that the man was intending to drive on.
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she called frantically. &ldquo;Please give us a
ride! We&rsquo;re lost and half frozen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man heard for he flashed an ugly smile. Shifting
gears, he drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the shabby tricks, that&rsquo;s the worst!&rdquo; Penny
said furiously. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t our fault his old truck
skidded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is our fault we&rsquo;re lost on this road,&rdquo; Louise
added. &ldquo;How are we ever to find the listening post?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Penny leaned against the leeward side of a giant
pine. Already it was so dark that she could see only
a few feet down the road. There were no houses, no
lights, nothing to guide her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, are we really lost?&rdquo; Louise demanded, suddenly
afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really, truly are,&rdquo; her chum answered in a
quavering voice. &ldquo;The post must be somewhere near
here, but we&rsquo;ll never find it. All we can do is try to
get back to the car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">2</span>
<br /><i>AT THE LISTENING POST</i></h2>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s courage did not long forsake her.
She had suggested to Louise that they return to the
stripped car, but she knew that would not solve their
problem. Staring up the dark road, she remarked
that they must be close to the summit of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not keep on?&rdquo; urged Louise. &ldquo;We set
out to find the listening post, so let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They trudged on up the winding road. At intervals,
in an attempt to restore circulation to numbed
feet, they ran a few steps. Snow fell steadily, whipping
and stinging their faces.</p>
<p>Gasping, half-winded, they kept doggedly on.
Finally they struggled into a clearing at the top of the
hill. Penny wiped her eyes and gazed down through a
gap in the white-coated evergreens. A quarter of the
way down the slope on the other side appeared a
glowing dot of light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s only a cabin,&rdquo; she said dubiously.
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be the airplane listening post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go there anyway,&rdquo; advised Louise. &ldquo;We can
warm ourselves and ask how to get back to civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed on, still following the road. Downhill
walking was much easier and at intervals they
were encouraged by a glimpse of the light.</p>
<p>Then, rounding a bend of the road, the girls came
to an artistic, newly constructed iron fence, banked
heavily with snow. The fence led to a high gate, and
behind the gate loomed a dark, sprawling house with
double chimneys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is deserted!&rdquo; Louise observed in disappointment.
&ldquo;What became of the light we&rsquo;ve been
following?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be farther on. This house looks as if it had
been closed for the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went to the gate and rattled a heavy chain
which held it in place. Peering through the palings,
she could see an unshoveled driveway which curved
gracefully to a pillared porch. The spacious grounds
were dotted with evergreens and shrubs, so layered
with snow that they resembled scraggly ghosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who owns this place?&rdquo; speculated Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Penny answered, turning away.
&ldquo;In fact, I don&rsquo;t recall ever having seen it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words carried special significance to Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve never seen this house before, then we&rsquo;re
on a strange road! Penny, we never will find the
listening post!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to suspect it myself,&rdquo; Penny admitted
grimly. &ldquo;But we must keep plodding on.
That light can&rsquo;t be far ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning their backs upon the gloomy estate, they
again braved the penetrating wind. Soon Louise lost
her footing and fell. She remained in a dispirited little
heap until Penny pulled her off the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep going, Lou,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be
long now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise allowed Penny to pull her along. They
rounded a curve in the road, and there, miraculously,
the lighted cabin rose before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; exulted Louise. &ldquo;The Promised Land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Staggering up a shoveled path, they pounded on
the cabin door. An old man, who held a kerosene
lamp, responded promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in!&rdquo; he invited heartily. &ldquo;Why,
you look half frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks aren&rsquo;t deceitful either,&rdquo; Penny laughed
shakily.</p>
<p>As the girls went into the warm room a little whirlpool
of wind and snow danced ahead of them.
Quickly the old man closed the door. He made
places for Penny and Louise at the stove and tossed in
a heavy stick of wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bad night to be out,&rdquo; he commented cheerfully.</p>
<p>Penny agreed that it was. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; she volunteered,
stripping off her wet mittens. &ldquo;At least we
can&rsquo;t find the airplane listening post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s just a piece farther on,&rdquo; the old man replied.
&ldquo;The tower&rsquo;s right hard to see in this storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they thawed out, the girls explained that they
had been forced to abandon their car at the Riverview
Yacht Club. The old man, whose name was Henry
Hammill, listened with deep sympathy to their tale
of woe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hitch up my horses and take you to Riverview
in the sled,&rdquo; he offered. &ldquo;That is, unless you&rsquo;d rather
stop at the listening tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would save you a long trip,&rdquo; Penny returned
politely. &ldquo;If Salt Sommers is on duty, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll
take us to our homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end it was decided that Old Henry should
drive the girls as far as the post. Then, if arrangements
could not be made with the photographer, he
would keep on to Riverview.</p>
<p>Warm at last, Penny and Louise declared that they
were ready to start. Old Henry brought the sled to
the door and the team soon was racing down the icy
road. Above the jingle of bells arose occasional
squeals of laughter, for the young passengers enjoyed
every minute of the unexpected ride.</p>
<p>Presently Old Henry pulled up at the side of the
road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the tower,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a two-story
wooden observatory rising above the evergreens.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait until you find out if your friend&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls thanked the old man for his kindly help
and scrambled from the sled. They were sure their
troubles were over, for they could see Salt Sommers
seated at a table in the lighted tower.</p>
<p>A flight of steps led to a narrow catwalk which ran
around three sides of the glass-enclosed house. Before
Penny and Louise could hammer on the door Salt
opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, see what the storm blew in!&rdquo; the young man
exclaimed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you girls to pop in on a
night like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt, how soon will you be driving to Riverview?&rdquo;
Penny asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty minutes. As soon as my relief
shows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we ride with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny called down from the catwalk to tell Old
Henry he need not wait. With a friendly wave of
his hand, the cabin owner drove away. The girls
then followed Salt into the drafty tower room.</p>
<p>Curiously they gazed at their surroundings. In the
center of the room stood a small coal stove. Above it
a tacked sign admonished: &ldquo;Keep this fire going!&rdquo;
There was a table, two chairs and a telephone. Also
a round clock which indicated seven-forty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Before Penny and Louise could explain why they
had come, Salt held up a warning finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that a plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran out on the catwalk, letting in an icy blast of
wind. In a moment he came back, grinning sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A passenger airplane is due through here about this
time. Sometimes I listen for it so hard I imagine the
sound of the engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The job must get tiresome at times,&rdquo; Penny ventured,
making herself comfortable by the glowing
stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it does, but I&rsquo;m glad to serve my trick. What
brings you girls here on such a wild night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story was quickly told. Nevertheless, by the
time Penny had telephoned to Mrs. Weems, it was
after eight o&rsquo;clock. Footsteps pounded on the stairway.
An elderly man, his hat and overcoat encrusted
with snow, swept into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My relief,&rdquo; said Salt, presenting Nate Adams to
the girls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free to shove off now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you can start your car,&rdquo; commented the
newcomer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty cold, and the temperature
is still dropping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt&rsquo;s battered coupe was parked not far from the
tower. Snow blanketed the windshield. He wiped
it away and after several attempts started the engine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think I&rsquo;d better stop at the first garage and have
more alcohol put in the radiator. No use in taking a
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt followed the same road over which the girls
had trudged an hour earlier. In passing the estate not
far from Old Henry&rsquo;s cabin, Penny peered with renewed
interest at the big house. In the blinding snow
storm she could not be sure, but she thought a light
gleamed from an upstairs window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt,&rdquo; she inquired, &ldquo;who lives in that place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; he replied, without turning his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone live there now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen anyone since I took over as observer
at the tower. Nate Adams tells me the estate has a
private air field. No planes have taken off or landed
while I&rsquo;ve been on duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw a light just now in an upstairs
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a reflection from the car headlights,&rdquo;
Salt answered carelessly.</p>
<p>The car passed Old Henry&rsquo;s cabin and crept on until
it came to a crossroad. Several buildings were
clustered on either side of the main highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll stop at Mattie&rsquo;s garage,&rdquo; Salt said.</p>
<p>As he pulled up on a gravel runway, a masculine
looking woman came to the door of the car. She was
in her mid-thirties and wore a man&rsquo;s coat much too
large for her. The girls guessed, and correctly, that
she was Mattie Williams, owner of the garage and
filling station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How many will you have?&rdquo; she asked Salt, briskly
clearing the windshield of snow.</p>
<p>The photographer replied that he did not require
gasoline, but wanted at least a quart of alcohol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive into the garage,&rdquo; the woman instructed,
opening a pair of double doors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Sam take
care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the car rolled into the building, Mattie shouted
loudly to a stoop-shouldered man who was busy in
the rear office: &ldquo;Hey, Sam! Look after this customer,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Burkholder slouched over to the car and began
to unscrew the radiator cap. Penny and Louise
assumed that the man must be Mattie&rsquo;s husband, but a
remark to that effect was corrected by Salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam is Mattie&rsquo;s partner,&rdquo; he explained in an undertone.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell which one of them is boss of
the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Losing interest in the pair, Penny and Louise
climbed out of the coupe. They had noticed a cafe
next door and thought they might go there for a cup
of hot coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Salt encouraged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here until
this job is finished, and join you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>As the girls let themselves out the garage door, a
truck pulled up in front of the cafe. They would
have given it no more than a casual glance had not the
driver alighted. He was a short, ruddy-faced man
with a missing front tooth which made his facial expression
rather grotesque. Without glancing at the
girls, he entered the restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man!&rdquo; exclaimed Louise. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we seen
him somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have indeed,&rdquo; agreed Penny grimly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the same driver who refused us a ride. Let&rsquo;s march in
there and give him a piece of our minds!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">3</span>
<br /><i>AN UNPLEASANT DRIVER</i></h2>
<p>From outside the lighted cafe, the girls could
see the truck driver slouched at one of the counter
stools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to go inside,&rdquo; said Louise, &ldquo;but why
start a fuss? After all, I suppose he had a right to refuse
us a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have frozen to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he probably didn&rsquo;t realize we were lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had your charitable disposition,&rdquo; Penny
said with a sniff. &ldquo;He heard me shout, and he drove
away just to be mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, let&rsquo;s forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise took Penny&rsquo;s elbow, steering her toward the
cafe. The girls had been friends since grade school
days. They made an excellent pair, for Louise exerted
a subduing effect upon her impulsive chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>The only daughter of Anthony Parker, publisher
of the <i>Star</i>, Penny had a talent for innocently getting
into trouble. Inactivity bored her. When nothing
more exciting offered, she frequently tried her hand at
writing stories for her father&rsquo;s newspaper. Such truly
important yarns as <i>The Vanishing Houseboat</i>, <i>The
Wishing Well</i>, <i>Behind the Green Door</i>, and <i>The
Clock Strikes Thirteen</i> had rolled from her typewriter.
Penny thoroughly enjoyed reportorial work,
but best of all she loved to take an active part in the
adventures she recounted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember,&rdquo; Louise warned her, &ldquo;not a word
to that truck driver. We&rsquo;ll just snub him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right. I&rsquo;ll try to behave myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grinning, Penny allowed herself to be guided toward
the restaurant. Near the doorway they came to
the parked truck, and noticed that it was loaded with
large wooden boxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;War equipment,&rdquo; commented Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the boxes are unmarked except by numerals.
Haven&rsquo;t you noticed, Lou, that&rsquo;s the way machines
and materials are transported to and from factories.
It&rsquo;s done so no one can tell what&rsquo;s inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny opened the door and they went into the
warm, smoky cafe. As they seated themselves at a
table the driver glanced toward them, but seemingly
without recognition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about a date tonight, Baby?&rdquo; he asked the
waitress.</p>
<p>Without replying, the girl slapped a menu card on
the counter in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High toned, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will it be?&rdquo; the waitress demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a nice smile, Baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning away, the waitress started to serve another
customer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme a cup o&rsquo; coffee and two sinkers,&rdquo; the driver
hurled after her. &ldquo;And make it snappy too! I&rsquo;m in a
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once the coffee and doughnuts had been set before
him, the man was in no haste to consume them.
He read a newspaper and fed a dollar and a half into
a pin-ball machine.</p>
<p>Penny and Louise ordered coffee. Knowing that
Salt might be waiting for them, they swallowed the
brew scalding hot and arose to leave.</p>
<p>At the cashier&rsquo;s desk Penny paid the bill. Upon impulse
she quietly asked the man behind the cash register
if he knew the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow by the name of Hank Biglow,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Before Penny could ask another question, a police
patrol car screeched to a standstill just outside the
restaurant. The cafe owner turned to stare as did the
driver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are those cops comin&rsquo; here for?&rdquo; Hank Biglow
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; retorted the cafe owner.
&ldquo;Maybe they want to ask you a few questions about
that cargo you carry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that crack?&rdquo; the driver
asked harshly.</p>
<p>As the cashier shrugged and did not reply, Hank
allowed the matter to pass. Although he remained at
the counter, he kept watching the police car through
the window.</p>
<p>The brief interchange between cafe owner and
driver had interested Penny. To delay her departure,
she bought a candy bar and began to unwrap it.</p>
<p>Only one policeman had alighted from the car.
Tramping into the cafe, he pounded his hands together
and sought the warmth of a radiator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind if I have a little of your heat?&rdquo; he asked the
cafe owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had been watching Hank Biglow. A moment
before the man had sat tense and nervous at the
counter. Now he seemed completely relaxed and at
ease as he sipped his coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hank,&rdquo; the policeman greeted him. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
see you at first. How&rsquo;s the trucking business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; the trucker growled. &ldquo;Workin&rsquo; me night
and day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>The casual conversation disappointed Penny. Her
first thought had been that Hank Biglow feared a
police investigation. Seemingly, she had indulged in
wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Having no further reason for remaining in the cafe,
the girls stepped out into the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pity that policeman wasn&rsquo;t looking for Hank
Biglow,&rdquo; Penny muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought for a minute he was,&rdquo; responded Louise,
stooping to fasten the buckle of her heavy overshoe.
&ldquo;At least Hank acted peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard what the cashier said to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the cargo he carried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Penny, &ldquo;what do you suppose he
meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it was intended as a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem that way to me, Lou. Hank took
offense at the remark. He was as nervous as a cat,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny stared curiously at the big truck which was
parked not far from the police car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what can be in those big boxes, Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few minutes ago you said they contained tools
or defense plant products.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only my guess. I assumed it from the
lack of marking on the boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny paused beside the big truck. Pressing her
face close to an opening between the slats, she counted
ten large crates, all the same size and shape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, maybe this isn&rsquo;t defense plant merchandise,&rdquo;
she speculated. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s some sort of contraband....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s words trailed off. Someone had touched
her on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Whirling around, she faced the same policeman
who a moment before had entered the cafe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just looking,&rdquo; stammered Penny. &ldquo;We
were wondering what&rsquo;s inside these boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Machinery,&rdquo; replied the policeman. &ldquo;Now skidoo!
Behave yourselves or I&rsquo;ll have to speak to your
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">4</span>
<br /><i>STOLEN TIRES</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry,&rdquo; Louise apologized to the
policeman. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t suppose it would do any harm
to look at the outside of the boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along, run along,&rdquo; the officer said impatiently.</p>
<p>Penny was tempted to make a rather pointed remark,
but Louise pulled her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never argue with a policeman,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;You always lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t doing any harm,&rdquo; Penny scowled.
&ldquo;What does he think we are, a couple of female spies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the garage, the girls saw that the car had
been serviced. Salt could be seen inside the little glass-enclosed
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for Sam Burkholder,&rdquo; he explained as
they joined him. &ldquo;He took care of the radiator and
then disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Louise loitered about the office, reading
the evening newspaper. After a little delay, Mattie
Williams appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give me my bill?&rdquo; Salt requested.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a hurry to get to Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Sam was looking after you,&rdquo; Mattie replied,
making out the slip.</p>
<p>The bill settled, Salt backed the car from the garage.
Penny noticed that Hank Biglow&rsquo;s truck no longer
stood in front of the cafe. The police car also had
gone. She would have thought no more of it, had not
Louise at that moment exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, that truck is parked at the rear of the
garage now! And they&rsquo;re unloading the boxes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny twisted around to see for herself. It was true
that the big truck had been backed up close to the
rear entrance of the garage. Through the blinding
snow, she could just see Hank Biglow and Sam Burkholder
carrying one of the boxes into the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Those crates
can&rsquo;t contain defense machinery or materials. Otherwise
Hank wouldn&rsquo;t be delivering them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What crates?&rdquo; inquired Salt, shifting gears.</p>
<p>Penny told him what had transpired in the cafe,
and revealed that she and Louise had been rebuked by
the policeman. Salt, occupied with driving, did not
consider the incident in any way significant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know how some cops are,&rdquo; he commented
carelessly.</p>
<p>The car went into a wild skid and Salt thereafter
devoted his attention strictly to driving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Without further mishap, the party arrived safely
at Riverview. Louise alighted at her own home, and
then Salt took Penny to the Parker residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in for a cup of chocolate?&rdquo; she
invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, not tonight,&rdquo; Salt replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead
tired. Think I&rsquo;ll hit the hay early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only one light burned in the living-room as Penny
stomped in out of the cold. Mrs. Weems, the plump
housekeeper who had served the Parkers for many
years, sat beside the hearth, sewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re home at last!&rdquo; she exclaimed, getting
up quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how worried I&rsquo;ve
been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Louise and I telephoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hear you very well. I barely was able
to make out that something had happened to your
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A major catastrophe, Mrs. Weems. Every tire
was stolen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the housekeeper bombarded her with questions,
Penny stripped off overshoes and heavy outer
clothing. Pools of water began to form on the rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take everything out to the kitchen,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems
said hastily. &ldquo;Have you had your supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even a nibble. And I&rsquo;m starving!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>As Mrs. Weems began to prepare a hot meal, Penny
perched herself on the kitchen table, alternately talking,
and chewing on a sugared bun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever were lost in an Arctic blizzard you
have a good picture of what Louise and I endured,&rdquo;
she narrated grandly. &ldquo;Oh, it was awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losing five practically new tires is a mere detail
in comparison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing less than a tragedy! I was thinking&mdash;maybe
you ought to break the sad news to Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not. You&rsquo;ll have to tell him yourself.
However, he&rsquo;s attending a meeting and won&rsquo;t be home
until eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s much too late for me,&rdquo; Penny said quickly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him in the morning. And I do hope you cooperate
by giving him a dandy breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just see to it that you don&rsquo;t oversleep,&rdquo; suggested
the housekeeper dryly.</p>
<p>Penny consumed an enormous supper and then
slipped off to bed. She did not hear her father come
home a few hours later. In the morning when Mrs.
Weems called her, it seemed advisable to take a long
time in dressing. Her father had gone by the time
she strolled downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Dad?&rdquo; she asked the housekeeper
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew I would,&rdquo; chided Mrs. Weems. &ldquo;Your
father expects to see you at his office at nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he take the blow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally one couldn&rsquo;t expect him to be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a deep sigh, Penny sat down to breakfast.
Worry over the coming interview did not interfere
with her usual excellent appetite. She had orange
juice, two slices of toast, four pancakes, and then,
somewhat concerned lest she lose her slim figure, debated
whether to ask for another helping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The batter&rsquo;s all gone,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems settled the
matter. &ldquo;Do stop dawdling and get on to the office.
Your father shouldn&rsquo;t be kept waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With anything but enthusiasm, Penny took herself
to the plant of the Riverview <i>Star</i>. Passing through
the busy newsroom where reporters pounded at their
typewriters, she entered her father&rsquo;s private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dad,&rdquo; she greeted him with forced cheerfulness.
&ldquo;Mrs. Weems said you wanted to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you lost five tires last night?&rdquo; the editor barked.
Mr. Parker was a lean, keen-eyed man of early middle
age, known throughout the state as a fearless newspaper
man. At the moment, Penny decided that
&ldquo;fearful&rdquo; would prove a more descriptive term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dad, it was this way&mdash;&rdquo; she began meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind a long-winded explanation,&rdquo; he interrupted,
smiling. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault&mdash;the car was
stripped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny wondered if she had heard correctly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your tires weren&rsquo;t the only ones stolen yesterday,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker resumed. &ldquo;A half dozen other thefts
were reported. In fact, I&rsquo;ve known for several weeks
that a professional gang of tire thieves has been operating
in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, you&rsquo;re a peach!&rdquo; Penny cried, making a
dive for him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you a great big kiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not,&rdquo; Mr. Parker grinned, pushing her
away. &ldquo;Try to remember, this is an office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny resigned herself to a chair. Questioned by
her father, she gave a straightforward account of how
the car had been stripped at the Yacht Club grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tire gang is getting bolder every day!&rdquo; Mr.
Parker exclaimed wrathfully. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll soon put a
stop to their little game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker hesitated and then said: &ldquo;I can trust you,
can&rsquo;t I, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you this in confidence. For weeks
Jerry Livingston, our star reporter, has been working
on the case. He&rsquo;s rounded up a lot of evidence against
the outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have a chance to get those tires back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking about that,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said impatiently.
&ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s gathered enough evidence to
smash the entire gang. It will be as big a story as the
<i>Star</i> ever published.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you breaking it, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow. Depends on the state prosecutor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Gilmore? What does he have to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This story is loaded with dynamite, Penny. If we
spread it over our front page before police have a
chance to act, the guilty parties are apt to make a
getaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; nodded Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another reason I want to consult the Prosecutor
before I use the story,&rdquo; Mr. Parker resumed.
&ldquo;Some of the men involved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tap sounded on the door. Without completing
what he had started to say, the editor called, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry Livingston entered the office. He was a
good-looking young man, alert and clean-cut. Smiling
at Penny, he slapped a folded paper on Mr. Parker&rsquo;s
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my story on the tire thefts, Chief,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, this winds up the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done fine work, Jerry,&rdquo; Mr. Parker praised.
&ldquo;Thanks to your work, we ought to clean out the
gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Chief. Guess you have all the proofs
needed to back up the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the evidence is locked in my safe. I have an
appointment scheduled with the Prosecutor. If he
Okays the story, we&rsquo;ll publish it tomorrow. By the
way, Jerry, what are your plans?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have a couple of weeks before I go into
the Army Air Corps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then treat yourself to a vacation, starting right
now,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Can you use it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; grinned Jerry. &ldquo;Know what I&rsquo;ll do? I&rsquo;ll
hop the noon train and head for the Canadian wilds on
a hunting trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker wrote out a check which he presented
to the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be sorry to lose you, Jerry,&rdquo; he said regretfully.
&ldquo;But remember, a job always will be waiting
when you return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter shook hands with Mr. Parker and
Penny, then left the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll miss Jerry around here,&rdquo; the editor remarked.</p>
<p>Penny nodded. She and Jerry had shared many an
adventure together, and he was one of her truest
friends. The office would not seem the same without
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My appointment with the Prosecutor is at ten-thirty,&rdquo;
said Mr. Parker briskly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gather my
papers and be on my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor placed Jerry&rsquo;s signed story in a leather
portfolio. Next he went to the safe and fumbled with
the dial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to open it for you?&rdquo; Penny asked, after
he had tried several times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, she stooped down,
twisted the dial a few times, and opened the heavy
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady, how did you learn the combination?&rdquo;
Mr. Parker demanded in chagrin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the numbers are written on the under side of
your desk,&rdquo; Penny grinned. &ldquo;Not a very good place
either! You must trust your office help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately my reporters aren&rsquo;t quite as observing
as a certain daughter,&rdquo; Mr. Parker retorted grimly.</p>
<p>The editor removed a fat brown envelope from
one of the drawers of the safe. Glancing at the papers
it contained, he added them to the contents of the
portfolio. He then locked the safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about letting me see that story?&rdquo; Penny
asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker smiled but shook his head. &ldquo;Only two
persons know the facts of the case&mdash;Jerry and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it a trio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be after I&rsquo;ve talked to the Prosecutor. I&rsquo;ve
got to step right along, too, or I&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll read the story in tomorrow&rsquo;s <i>Star</i>&mdash;I hope,&rdquo;
her father laughed. Picking up the portfolio, he
started for the door. &ldquo;Just contain your impatience
until I get back. And please keep those slippery little
fingers away from my safe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">5</span>
<br /><i>AN IMPORTANT INTERVIEW</i></h2>
<p>After her father had gone, Penny remained in
the private office. Eager to be off, Mr. Parker had
neglected to make any arrangements concerning the
stripped car at the Riverview Yacht Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; she thought impatiently. &ldquo;Now I
must wait here until he comes back to learn what I&rsquo;m
to do. The car should be hauled home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny wrote a letter on the typewriter. As she
searched for a stamp, the door swung open. A slightly
bald, angular man with hard brown eyes, paused on
the threshold. The man was Harley Schirr, an assistant
editor, next in authority to Mr. DeWitt. Of
the entire <i>Star</i> staff, he was the only person Penny
actively disliked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good morning, Miss Parker,&rdquo; he said with
elaborate courtesy. &ldquo;Your father isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he went away a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you are taking care of the office in his absence?&rdquo;
Mr. Schirr smiled. Even so, to Penny&rsquo;s
sensitive ears, the words had an insolent ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m merely waiting for him to return,&rdquo; she answered
briefly. &ldquo;I came to find out what to do about
the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I heard that all of your tires were stolen
last night.&rdquo; Mr. Schirr&rsquo;s lips twitched. &ldquo;Too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may get them back again. Dad says&mdash;&rdquo; Penny
checked herself, remembering that the information
given her by her father was to be kept secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; encouraged the assistant editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps police will catch the thieves,&rdquo; she completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t count on it if I were you, Miss Parker.
Black Markets have flourished in this city for months.
Nothing&rsquo;s been done to stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean by a Black Market, Mr.
Schirr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Illegal trading in various scarce commodities.
Tires either stolen or hijacked, are sold by the crooks
to so-called honest dealers who serve the public. It&rsquo;s
now a big-time business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Dad think about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I really couldn&rsquo;t tell you. Your father
doesn&rsquo;t discuss his editorial policy with me. If he did,
I&rsquo;d warn him to lay off all those tire-theft stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed quickly at the assistant editor, wondering
how much he knew of her father&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad usually prints all the news,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why
should he soft-pedal the tire stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For his health&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Mr. Schirr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assistant editor had closed the door behind
him. Warming to his subject, he replied: &ldquo;The men
who have muscled into the tire theft racket are ugly
lads without scruples. If your father stupidly insists
upon trying to smash the outfit, he may not wake up
some morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion that her father might ruthlessly be
done away with shocked Penny. And a canny corner
of her mind demanded to know how Mr. Schirr could
be so well informed. She was quite certain her father
had not taken him into his confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad is no coward,&rdquo; she said proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no one ever questioned his bravery, Miss
Parker. Your father is courageous to the point of
rashness. But if he prints an expos&eacute; story about the
tire theft gang, it&rsquo;s apt to prove the most foolish act
of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know he intends to do such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question, sharply put, surprised Mr. Schirr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he denied hastily. &ldquo;I merely heard
the rumor around the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny made no reply. As the silence became noticeable,
the assistant editor murmured that he would
return to see Mr. Parker later and left the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Penny glared at the man&rsquo;s retreating back. Even
more intensely than before, she disliked Harley Schirr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old sneak cat!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cent
he&rsquo;s been listening at the door or prying in Dad&rsquo;s
papers! I&rsquo;m sure no rumors have been circulating
around the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang. Automatically Penny took
down the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker?&rdquo; inquired a masculine voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here now. This is his daughter speaking.
May I take a message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No message,&rdquo; said the purring voice. &ldquo;Mr. Parker
may hear from me later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this, please?&rdquo; asked Penny quickly.</p>
<p>There was no answer, only the click of a receiver
being hung on its hook.</p>
<p>The incident, although trifling, annoyed Penny.
Getting up from the desk, she walked to the window.
Mr. Schirr&rsquo;s intimation had alarmed her, and now the
telephone call added to her uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the man who telephoned is well known
to Dad,&rdquo; she tried to assure herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just imagining
that his voice sounded sinister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling the need of an occupation, Penny wandered
out into the editorial room. She chatted with the
society editor and for a time watched the world news
reports coming in on the noisy teletype machines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Need a job?&rdquo; inquired Editor DeWitt at the slot
of the circular copy desk. &ldquo;How about writing a few
headlines for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; Penny declined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just waiting
for Dad. He should be back any minute now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was eleven-forty by the office clock. Never had
time seemed to pass so slowly. As Penny debated
whether or not to wait any longer, there was a sudden
stir in the room. Glancing toward the outside door,
she saw that Jerry Livingston, suitcase in hand, had
entered.</p>
<p>Immediately reporters and editors left their desks
to shake his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry, you&rsquo;re the best reporter this paper ever
had,&rdquo; Mr. DeWitt told him warmly. &ldquo;We surely hate
to see you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; the reporter answered. &ldquo;You
can bet on that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny crossed the room to say goodbye. Jerry
surprisingly tucked her arm through his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along and see me off on the train,&rdquo; he invited,
pulling her along. &ldquo;Not doing anything special,
are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just waiting for Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on,&rdquo; Jerry grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot
to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, once in the taxi, speeding toward the
railroad station, the reporter scarcely spoke. He
reached out and captured her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to miss you, little twirp,&rdquo; he sighed.
&ldquo;No telling when I&rsquo;ll get back to the <i>Star</i>. Maybe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t try to work on my sympathies,&rdquo;
laughed Penny, though a lump came in her throat.
&ldquo;Oh, Jerry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your command. Just break down and confess
how desolate you&rsquo;ll be without me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The railroad station was close by and Penny had
only a moment to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Riverview will be a blank without you,&rdquo; she admitted.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s that tire-theft story I want to ask
you about. Did you ever tell anyone that Dad is
planning to expose the gang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t give out any information,&rdquo;
Penny said in relief. &ldquo;But somehow Harley Schirr
has learned about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schirr! That egg? How could he have found
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know myself. He hinted that something
dreadful might happen to Dad if the story is
printed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jerry patted Penny&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give it a
thought, kid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Schirr does a lot of wild talking.
Probably whatever he said to you was pure
bluff. He doesn&rsquo;t know a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The arrival of the cab at the station put an end to
the conversation. Jerry paid the driver and hustled
Penny inside. He barely had time to purchase a
ticket before the train was called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, goodbye,&rdquo; Jerry said, squeezing her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good time in Canada,&rdquo; Penny replied.
&ldquo;And bring me a nice bear rug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll catch him with my bare hands,&rdquo; Jerry
rejoined, making a feeble attempt at a joke.</p>
<p>The train began to move. The reporter swung
himself aboard the last Pullman. As he waved from
the steps, Penny realized that she had forgotten to
ask for his Canadian address.</p>
<p>Soon the train was only a blur down the frosty
tracks. Penny climbed a steep ramp to the street.
She felt lonesome, and for some reason, discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I lose my car wheels, and now it&rsquo;s Jerry,&rdquo;
she reflected sadly. &ldquo;What a week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny scarcely knew whether to go home or to the
<i>Star</i> office. As she debated the matter, her ears were
assaulted by the shrill scream of a siren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire,&rdquo; thought Penny.</p>
<p>An ambulance rushed past. It raced to the end of
the short street and pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably an accident,&rdquo; amended Penny.</p>
<p>Curious to learn what had happened, she began to
run. At the end of the street a large crowd had
gathered. A car with a smashed fender and damaged
front grillwork, had piled against a street lamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Penny asked a man who stood
beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two cars in a smash-up,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
see the accident myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what became of the other automobile?&rdquo; asked
Penny.</p>
<p>She pushed through the gathering crowd to the
curb. Broken glass was scattered over the pavement.
Ambulance men were searching the wreckage of the
car which had struck the lamp post. The other automobile,
apparently, had driven away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Penny&rsquo;s gaze riveted on the rear license
plate of the smashed car. In horror she read the number&mdash;P-619-10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s car!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">6</span>
<br /><i>FRONT PAGE NEWS</i></h2>
<p>Never in her life had Penny been more frightened.
Breaking away from the group of people at the curb,
she ran to the parked ambulance. A glance into the
interior assured her that Mr. Parker had not been
placed inside on a stretcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she asked wildly. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A white-garbed ambulance attendant turned to
stare at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my father&rsquo;s car!&rdquo; Penny cried, pointing to
the battered sedan. &ldquo;Tell me, was he badly hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attendant tried to be kind. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,
Miss. Someone put in a call for us. Said we were to
pick up an injured man. Evidently he was taken to
a hospital before we could get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happened,&rdquo; contributed a small boy
who stood close by. &ldquo;A woman drove by in an auto.
She offered to take the man to the hospital and he
went with her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A tall, lean man in a gray suit?&rdquo; Penny asked
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He had a leather case in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was my father!&rdquo; Penny cried. &ldquo;How
badly was he hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he could walk all right,&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;He
seemed kinda dazed though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly relieved to learn that her father had escaped
serious injury, Penny sought more information. The
boy who had witnessed the accident, told her that
the car which had caused the smash-up, was a blue
sedan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men were in it,&rdquo; he revealed. &ldquo;They started
to go around your father&rsquo;s car and crowded him toward
the curb. Next thing I saw, he&rsquo;d plowed into
the lamp post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other car didn&rsquo;t stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it didn&rsquo;t! You should have seen &rsquo;em
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you notice the license number?&rdquo; Penny
asked hopefully.</p>
<p>The boy shook his head.</p>
<p>Having learned all she could from him, Penny questioned
other persons. Only one woman in the crowd
was able to provide additional information. Her eye-witness
account differed slightly from the boy&rsquo;s, but
she confirmed that a middle-aged woman in a black
coupe had taken the accident victim to a hospital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which hospital?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>The woman could not tell her. She did say, however,
that the accident victim seemingly had suffered
only minor scratches.</p>
<p>A police car drove up. Penny, frantic to find her
father, did not wish to be delayed by questions.
Without revealing who she was to members of the
investigation squad, she hailed a taxi. Mercy Hospital
was only a few blocks away. It seemed reasonable
that her father would be taken there for treatment.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, standing anxiously at the information
desk of that institution, she learned that
Mr. Parker had not been admitted as a patient. The
nurse in charge, noting the girl&rsquo;s agitation, kindly
offered to telephone other hospitals. After six calls,
she reported that she was unable to trace the accident
victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that your father sought hospital
treatment?&rdquo; she asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. Dad wasn&rsquo;t badly hurt according to
witnesses. He may have gone elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking the nurse for her help, Penny taxied
swiftly home. Mrs. Weems, in an old coat and a
turban, was pouring salt on the icy sidewalk in front
of the house. From the look on her face it was evident
she had not heard the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems, Dad&rsquo;s been hurt!&rdquo; Penny cried, leaping
from the cab. &ldquo;In an auto accident!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My land!&rdquo; the housekeeper gasped and allowed the
bag of salt to fall from her gloved hand. &ldquo;How bad
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he was more stunned than anything else.
But I&rsquo;ve not been able to learn where he was taken.
He didn&rsquo;t telephone here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless it was since I&rsquo;ve been outdoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up the bag of salt, Mrs. Weems followed
Penny into the house. Without removing coat or
hat, the girl dialed the <i>Star</i> office. Editor DeWitt
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Dad arrived there?&rdquo; Penny asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t returned. Anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tersely Penny revealed what had occurred. The
news shocked the editor for he bore Mr. Parker a
genuine affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; he tried to cheer her.
&ldquo;Your father can&rsquo;t be badly hurt or he never would
have walked away from that accident. Just sit tight
and our reporters will locate him for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the next hour Penny and Mrs. Weems remained
near the telephone. Each moment they
waited, their anxiety increased. Mr. DeWitt did not
phone. There was no word from the police station.
They refused to believe that Mr. Parker had been
seriously injured, yet it seemed strange he could not be
found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like him to allow anyone to worry,&rdquo; declared
the housekeeper. &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t understand
why he doesn&rsquo;t call to relieve our minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the telephone bell jingled. Penny
snatched the receiver from its hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DeWitt speaking,&rdquo; said the familiar voice of the
editor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; Penny asked quickly. &ldquo;Did you find
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the editor confessed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
personally called the police station, every hospital
and private nursing home in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad may have gone to a doctor&rsquo;s office for treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; replied DeWitt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
checked all the likely ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have become of him?&rdquo; Penny asked
desperately. &ldquo;Mrs. Weems and I are dreadfully worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll show up any minute,&rdquo; comforted Mr.
DeWitt. &ldquo;Probably he doesn&rsquo;t realize anyone is looking
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny asked the editor if he had learned the identity
of the hit-skip driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one took down the license number of the car,&rdquo;
Mr. DeWitt returned regretfully. &ldquo;Our reporters
are still working on the story though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The story,&rdquo; murmured Penny faintly. For the
first time it occurred to her that her father&rsquo;s accident
and subsequent disappearance would be regarded as
front page news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to run an account of the accident
until I&rsquo;ve talked to your father,&rdquo; DeWitt said hastily.
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t worry about anything. I&rsquo;ll let you know
the minute I have any news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny hung up the receiver and reported the conversation
to Mrs. Weems. A clock on the mantel
chimed one-thirty, reminding the housekeeper that
lunch had not been prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No food for me,&rdquo; pleaded Penny. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel
like eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rather lost my own appetite,&rdquo; confessed the
housekeeper. &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s foolish of us to worry.
Your father must be safe. No doubt he had an appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;ve been so dumb!
Dad may still be in conference with Prosecutor Gilmore!
I&rsquo;ll call there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darting to the telephone, she waited patiently until
she was connected with the State prosecutor&rsquo;s office.
The lawyer himself talked to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Mr. Parker hasn&rsquo;t been here,&rdquo; he replied
to her eager inquiry. &ldquo;I expected him at ten-thirty.
Then he telephoned that he had been delayed
and would see me at eleven-thirty. He failed
to keep that appointment also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information sent Penny&rsquo;s hopes glimmering.
She explained about the accident and listened to the
Prosecutor&rsquo;s expression of sympathy. Replacing the
receiver, she turned once more to Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more worried than ever now,&rdquo; she quavered.
&ldquo;Dad didn&rsquo;t keep his appointment with Prosecutor
Gilmore, and it was a vitally important one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hear from him soon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Penny took a quick turn
across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, such a thing to say! What do you mean,
Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad has enemies. Harley Schirr told me today
that if any attempt was made to expose a certain gang
of thieves, it would mean real trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your father has had no connection with such
persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Jerry worked on a case together,&rdquo; Penny
explained. &ldquo;Today at the time of the accident, Dad
carried a brief case with all the evidence in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, I fail to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the report, Dad&rsquo;s car was practically
forced off the road,&rdquo; Penny added excitedly. &ldquo;I
think that auto crash was deliberately engineered!
Don&rsquo;t you understand, Mrs. Weems? He&rsquo;s fallen
into the clutches of his enemies!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Penny,&rdquo; soothed the housekeeper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure we&rsquo;re making far too much of the accident.
We&rsquo;ll soon hear from your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that to comfort me, Mrs. Weems.
Something dreadful has happened! I can <i>feel</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny ceased pacing the floor and went to the hall
closet for her hat and coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked the housekeeper,
her eyes troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the newspaper office. If word comes, I want
to be there to get it the very first minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems started to protest, then changed her
mind. She merely said: &ldquo;Telephone me the moment
you have any news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brisk walk to the <i>Star</i> office did much to restore
Penny&rsquo;s sagging courage. As she entered the newsroom,
brushing snow from her coat, she saw a group
of reporters gathered about Mr. DeWitt&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;News of Dad!&rdquo; she thought, her pulse pounding.</p>
<p>Glimpsing Penny, the men at the desk began to
scatter. They gazed at her in such a kind, sympathetic
manner that she became frightened again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mr. DeWitt?&rdquo; she asked the editor.
&ldquo;Has Dad been found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must have had some news,&rdquo; she insisted,
her gaze on a folded paper which he held. &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t hide anything from me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; DeWitt responded quietly. &ldquo;We
found this letter in your father&rsquo;s waste-basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny took the paper. Silently she read the message
which had been typed in capital letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MR. PARKER,&rdquo; it warned, &ldquo;THIS IS TO ADVISE
YOU TO LAY OFF ON TIRE THEFT
STORIES IN YOUR PAPER. UNLESS YOU
CHANGE YOUR POLICY YOU MAY WAKE
UP IN A DITCH.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>

<br /><span class="large">7</span>
<br /><i>QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANSWERS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not have shown that note to you,&rdquo;
Mr. DeWitt said quietly. &ldquo;We found it only a
moment ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it get in Dad&rsquo;s waste-basket?&rdquo; Penny
asked. &ldquo;Do you suppose he threw it there himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my guess. Your father never paid any attention
to unsigned letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny reread the threatening note, trying not to
show how much it disturbed her. &ldquo;I wonder if this
came by mail?&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; DeWitt replied. &ldquo;There was
no envelope in the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad never mentioned such a note to me,&rdquo; Penny
resumed, frowning. &ldquo;Probably thought I&rsquo;d worry
about it. This makes the situation look bad, doesn&rsquo;t
it, Mr. DeWitt?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>The editor weighed his words carefully before he
spoke. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t prove that your father was waylaid
by enemies, Penny. Not at all. According to reports,
Mr. Parker was involved in an ordinary automobile
accident, and left the scene of his own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a woman who drove a black car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, according to eye-witnesses she offered to take
him to a hospital for treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of that woman?&rdquo; demanded Penny.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t the police find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could say more, Harley Schirr came
to the desk, spreading a dummy sheet for the editor
to inspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the front-page layout,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;For
the banner we&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em, &lsquo;Anthony Parker Mysteriously
Disappears,&rsquo; and beneath it, a double column
story. I dug a good picture out of the morgue&mdash;the
one with Parker dedicating the Riverview Orphans&rsquo;
Home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt frowned as he studied the layout. &ldquo;Parker
wouldn&rsquo;t like this, Schirr. It&rsquo;s too sensational. Bust
that banner and cut the story down to the bare facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is a big story&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting Mr. Parker to walk in here any
minute,&rdquo; retorted DeWitt. &ldquo;A &lsquo;disappearance&rsquo; spread
would make the <i>Star</i> look silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker&rsquo;s not going to show up!&rdquo; Schirr refuted,
his eyes blazing. &ldquo;I say we should play the
story for all it&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Dad would hate sensationalism,&rdquo; Penny
said, siding with Mr. DeWitt.</p>
<p>The assistant editor turned to glare at her. Although
he made no reply, she read anger and dislike
in his flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the story down,&rdquo; DeWitt ordered curtly.
&ldquo;And try to find a more suitable picture of Mr.
Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schirr swept the dummy sheet from the desk,
crumpling it in his hand. As he started for the
morgue where pictures were filed, he muttered to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s got into that fellow lately,&rdquo;
DeWitt sighed.</p>
<p>The editor sat down rather heavily and Penny
noticed that he looked tired and pale. For fifteen
years he had been closely associated with Mr. Parker,
regarding his chief with deep affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel well, Mr. DeWitt?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so hot,&rdquo; he admitted, reaching for a pencil.
&ldquo;Lately I&rsquo;ve been having a little pain in my side&mdash;it&rsquo;s
nothing though. Just getting old, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not take the day off, Mr. DeWitt? You&rsquo;ve
been working too hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wouldn&rsquo;t this be a fine time to go home?&rdquo;
the editor barked. &ldquo;Hard work agrees with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Reminded that she was keeping Mr. DeWitt from
his duties, Penny soon left the <i>Star</i> office. Debating a
moment, she walked to the nearby police station.
There she was courteously received by Chief Jalman,
a personal friend of her father&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find Mr. Parker,&rdquo; he assured her confidently.
&ldquo;His description has been broadcast over the radio.
We&rsquo;ve instructed all our men to be on the watch for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny broached the possibility that her father had
been waylaid by enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Facts fail to support such a theory,&rdquo; replied Chief
Jalman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion your father will show up
any hour, wondering what the fuss is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny left the police station rather cheered. Almost
without thinking, she chose a route which led
toward the scene of the accident. Reaching the familiar
street, she noted that her father&rsquo;s battered car
had been towed away. All broken glass had been
swept from the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was here before I should have questioned
more people,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It never occurred to
me then that Dad would fail to show up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noticing a candy store which fronted the street
close to the bent lamp post, Penny went inside. A
friendly looking woman with gray hair came to serve
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a customer,&rdquo; Penny explained. She added
that her father had been injured in the car accident,
and that she was seeking information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already been questioned by police detectives,&rdquo;
replied the owner of the candy shop. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
can&rsquo;t tell you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you witness the accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I saw it, but it happened so fast I wasn&rsquo;t
sure whose fault it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t take down the license number of the
blue hit-skip car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it blue?&rdquo; the woman inquired. &ldquo;Now I told
the police, maroon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My information came from a small boy, so he may
have been mistaken. Did you notice the woman who
offered my father a ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she was about my age&mdash;around forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather plainly, I would say. But she drove a fine,
late-model car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you consider her a woman of means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging from the car&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny asked many more questions, trying to gain
an accurate picture of the woman who had aided her
father. She was somewhat reassured when the candy
shop owner insisted that Mr. Parker had entered the
car of his own free will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he seem dazed by the accident?&rdquo; she asked
thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, he did. I saw your father get into the
car sort of holding his head. Then he asked the
woman to stop at the curb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d forgotten something&mdash;a leather carrying
case. At any rate, he returned to his own auto for it.
Then he drove away with the woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As puzzled as ever, Penny went out on the street
once more. The weather had turned colder, but she
scarcely felt the icy blast which whipped her face.</p>
<p>It was silly to worry, she told herself sternly. Why,
all the facts supported Police Chief Jalman&rsquo;s belief
that her father soon would return home. Mrs.
Weems was confident he would be found safe&mdash;so was
Mr. DeWitt. After all, only five hours had elapsed
since the accident. A disappearance couldn&rsquo;t be considered
serious in such a short period.</p>
<p>But try as she might, Penny could not free her
mind of grave misgivings. She could not forget the
mysterious telephone call, the threatening letter, and
Harley Schirr&rsquo;s cocksure opinion that her father
would not be found.</p>
<p>She stood disconsolate, gazing into the whirling
snow storm. At the end of the street the railroad station
loomed as a dark blur, reminding her of Jerry.
If only he hadn&rsquo;t gone away! Jerry was the one person
who might help her, and she knew of no way to
reach him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">8</span>
<br /><i>A FEW CHANGES</i></h2>
<p>Next morning, Penny, red-eyed because she
had slept little, walked slowly toward the <i>Star</i> office.
Throughout the long night there had been no word
from Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>At every street corner newsboys shouted the latest
headlines&mdash;that the publisher had been missing nearly
twenty-four hours. Even the <i>Star</i> carried a black,
ugly banner across its front page.</p>
<p>Penny bought a copy, reading with displeasure
the story of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why Mr. DeWitt let this go
through,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If Dad were here, he&rsquo;d certainly
hate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the lobby of the <i>Star</i> building, Penny
pressed the elevator button. A long time elapsed before
the cage descended. To her surprise she saw
that it was operated, not by Mose Johnson, the colored
man, but by the janitor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to keep you waiting, Miss Penny,&rdquo; the man
apologized. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much good at operating this
contraption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mose this morning, Charley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny could not hide her amazement. The old
colored man had been employed ten years at the <i>Star</i>
plant. Although not strictly efficient, Mose&rsquo;s habits
were good, and Mr. Parker had taken an affectionate
interest in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, if you ask me,&rdquo; the janitor added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened, Charley? Who discharged
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That guy Schirr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harley Schirr? But he has no authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An editor can fire and hire. I think he was just
tryin&rsquo; out his stuff on poor old Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During my father&rsquo;s absence, Mr. DeWitt is in
full charge here,&rdquo; Penny said emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DeWitt <i>was</i> in charge. But they hauled him off
to the hospital last night with a bad pain in his tummy.
Seems he had an appendicitis attack. The doctor
rushed him off and didn&rsquo;t even wait until morning to
operate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news stunned Penny. She murmured that she
hoped Mr. DeWitt was doing well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon he is,&rdquo; agreed the janitor. &ldquo;We all
chipped in and sent him some flowers&mdash;roses. Mose
gave fifty cents, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s mind came back to the problem of the
colored man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mr. Schirr discharged him,&rdquo; she commented.
&ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The janitor pressed a button and the cage moved
slowly upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mose was due on at midnight,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t get here until after two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he have a reason for being so late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cage stopped with a jerk. &ldquo;Sure, Mose had a
pip this time! Something about being detained by a
ghost! Schirr didn&rsquo;t go for it at all. Swelled up like
a poisoned pup and fired Mose on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;Dad liked Mose a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news from your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. As far as possible she was
determined to keep her troubles to herself. Turning
to leave the cage, she inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mose now? At home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down in the boiler room, sittin&rsquo; by the furnace.
Says he&rsquo;s afraid to go home for fear his old
lady will give him the works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please ask Mose to wait there for me?&rdquo;
Penny requested. &ldquo;I want to talk to him before he
leaves the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to tell him,&rdquo; the janitor said. Hesitating,
he added: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got any influence with
Schirr, you might speak a good word for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why for you?&rdquo; smiled Penny. &ldquo;Surely your job
is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; the janitor responded
gloomily. &ldquo;This morning when Schirr was comin&rsquo;
up in the elevator he said to me: &lsquo;Charley, there&rsquo;s
going to be a few changes made around here. I&rsquo;m going
to cut out all the old, useless timber.&rsquo; He looked
at me kinda funny-like too. You know, I passed my
sixty-eighth birthday last August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t start worrying, Charley,&rdquo; Penny
cheered him. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t run this building without
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply troubled, she tramped down the hall to the
newsroom. Reporters were in a fever of activity,
pounding out their stories. Copy boys had a nervous,
tense expression as they ran to and fro on their errands.
Harley Schirr, however, was not in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Big Shot has sealed himself in your father&rsquo;s
office!&rdquo; informed one of the copy desk men in a
muted voice. &ldquo;Guess you heard about DeWitt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Great Genius has taken over, and how! This
place is operating on an efficiency-plus basis now.
Why, he&rsquo;s got me so cockeyed, I compose poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny crossed to her father&rsquo;s office, tapping on the
frosted glass door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; demanded Schirr, his voice loud and
unpleasant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Penny spoke her name. In a moment the door
opened, and the editor bowed and smiled. As if she
were a guest of honor, he motioned her to a seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing everything we can to trace your
father,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So far, we&rsquo;ve had no luck and the
police admit they are baffled. I can&rsquo;t express to you
how sorry I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Penny&rsquo;s ears the words were words only, lacking
sincerity. Determining to waste no time, she
spoke of DeWitt&rsquo;s sudden illness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he&rsquo;ll be off duty for at least a month,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Schirr. &ldquo;Naturally in his absence I have
assumed charge. We put out a real paper this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the front page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny longed to say that the story about her father
had displeased her. However, she knew it would do
no good. The account, once printed, could not be
recalled. Far better, she reasoned, to let the matter
pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear Mose Johnson has been discharged,&rdquo; she
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we had to let him go.&rdquo; Mr. Schirr opened a
desk drawer, helping himself to one of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s
cigars. &ldquo;Mose is indolent, irresponsible&mdash;a drag on
the payroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father always liked him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did seem to favor the old coot,&rdquo; agreed
Schirr with a shrug. &ldquo;Well, thank you for dropping
in, Miss Parker. If we have any encouraging news,
I&rsquo;ll see that you are notified at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well aware that she had been dismissed, Penny left
the office. Schirr&rsquo;s attitude angered her. He had
made her feel unwelcome in her own father&rsquo;s newspaper
plant.</p>
<p>As she closed the door behind her, she realized that
nearly every eye in the apparently-busy newsroom,
had focused upon her. Deliberately, she composed
herself. Acting undisturbed, she swept past the rows
of desks to a rear stairway leading to the basement.</p>
<p>The janitor had delivered her message to Mose
Johnson. She found the old colored man curled up
fast asleep on a crate by the warm stove.</p>
<p>Penny touched Mose on the arm. He straightened
up as suddenly as if someone had set off a fire-cracker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Penny!&rdquo; he beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;se suah su&rsquo;prised
at seein&rsquo; you down heah in dis dumpy fu&rsquo;nace room.
But I thanks you just the same fo&rsquo; wakin&rsquo; me up out
o&rsquo; dat ghost dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you having a ghost dream?&rdquo; echoed Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss. Yo&rsquo; see I was dreamin&rsquo; about dat same
ghost I saw last night on de way to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, fully aware that Mose was directing the conversation
where he wished it to go, hid a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard about that, Mose,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;It
must have been quite a lively ghost to make you two
hours late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It suah was a lively ghost,&rdquo; Mose confirmed, bobbing
his woolly head. &ldquo;Why, it walked around jest
like a live pu&rsquo;son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you being a bit superstitious, Mose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deedy not, Miss. You is supe&rsquo;stitious when you
sees a ghost dat ain&rsquo;t dar. But when you sees one dat
is dar you ain&rsquo;t supe&rsquo;stitious. You is jest plain scared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell me about it,&rdquo; Penny invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Penny, it was like dis,&rdquo; began the old
colored man. &ldquo;At half past eleven I starts off fo&rsquo; work
same as always. I picks up mah lunch box de ole lady
packed fo&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; scoots off toward de bus stop to get
de 11:45. But I nevah get dar. When I was goin&rsquo;
down dat road runnin&rsquo; past de old Harrison place, I
seen de ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Harrison place?&rdquo; interrupted Penny. &ldquo;Where
is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know de road that winds up Craig Hill? It&rsquo;s
out towa&rsquo;d de boat club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that big estate house with the
fence surrounding it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s de place! Well, I seed dis heah ghost a cavortin&rsquo;
around behind de big iron gate dat goes in to
de old Harrison place. De ghost nevah sees me, but
I gets a good close-up of him. He was dressed in
white and he was carryin&rsquo; his own tombstone around
in his arms jes&rsquo; like it doan weigh nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mose!&rdquo; protested Penny. &ldquo;And then what
happened? Did the ghost disappear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss,&rdquo; grinned the colored man, &ldquo;but I did!
I turns tail an&rsquo; runs as fast as a man half mah age could
go, an&rsquo; I nevah stops fo&rsquo; nuthin&rsquo; till I gits back to mah
own place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I tells mah ole lady what was goin&rsquo; on she
says, &lsquo;Mose, you sees white ghosts &rsquo;cause you been a
drinkin&rsquo; some mo&rsquo; o&rsquo; dat white-eye. It&rsquo;s twelve
o&rsquo;clock dis minute and you&rsquo;se missed de last bus.
Now you start walkin&rsquo;! And if you is fired, don&rsquo;t
nevah da&rsquo;ken dat do&rsquo; no mo&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mose drew a deep sigh. &ldquo;And dat&rsquo;s jest what
happened, Miss Penny. I ain&rsquo;t got no job an&rsquo; no mo&rsquo;
home than a rabbit. I&rsquo;se suah bubblin&rsquo; oveh with
trouble. It all come from seein&rsquo; dat ghost you says I
didn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you thought you saw one,&rdquo; replied Penny.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll promise to attend strictly to your duties
hereafter, I&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Schirr to reinstate you on the
payroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Mose brightened. &ldquo;I suah nuff will!&rdquo; he said
jubilantly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have no mo&rsquo; truck with dat
ghost. No sir!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>To face Mr. Schirr once more, was a most unpleasant
ordeal for Penny. Nevertheless, she sought his
office, apologizing for the intrusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> busy,&rdquo; the editor said pointedly. &ldquo;What is
it you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny explained that she had talked with Mose
Johnson and was convinced that his offense would
not be repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to put him back on his old job,&rdquo; she
requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you take that attitude?&rdquo; inquired Penny,
stiffening for an argument. &ldquo;Dad always liked
Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t mix sentiment with business. I have a
job to do here and I intend to do it efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad probably will show up before another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to dash your hopes,&rdquo; said Mr. Schirr.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried to spare your feelings. Perhaps your
father will be found, but you know I tried to warn
him he was inviting trouble when he mixed with the
tire-theft gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you believe Dad has fallen into the clutches of
those men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think so? Have you any evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a scrap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you learn Dad intended to expose
the higher-ups?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you I heard him talking to
Jerry Livingston about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting nowhere with this discussion,&rdquo; Mr.
Schirr said impatiently. &ldquo;I really am busy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you reinstate Mose?&rdquo; Penny asked, reverting
to the original subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already given my answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, this is my father&rsquo;s paper,&rdquo; Penny said,
trying to control her voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a corporation.
Only Dad&rsquo;s money is invested here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a personal favor I ask you to reinstate Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making an issue of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it that if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Schirr&rsquo;s dark eyes blazed. He slammed a paper
weight across the desk and it dropped to the floor
with a hard thud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said stiffly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll restore your pet
to the payroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Schirr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But get this, Miss Parker,&rdquo; the editor completed.
&ldquo;We may as well have an understanding. While your
father is absent, I&rsquo;m in full charge here. In the future
I&rsquo;ll have no interference from you or any other
person.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">9</span>
<br /><i>AN OPEN SAFE</i></h2>
<p>Rather flattened by the interview with Mr.
Schirr, Penny was glad to leave the <i>Star</i> plant. Going
down in the elevator, she requested Charley to
tell Mose Johnson that he had been restored to his
old job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; the janitor beamed. &ldquo;Mighty glad
to hear it.&rdquo; Opening the cage door, he inquired:
&ldquo;Will you be going to see Mr. DeWitt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at City Hospital. You might tell him that
we all miss him around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly deliver the message,&rdquo; promised Penny.</p>
<p>City Hospital was only six blocks away. Penny
bought flowers and then presented herself at the institution.
After a brief wait in the lobby, she was
allowed to see Mr. DeWitt for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she said cheerfully, handing the
box of flowers to a nurse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Mr. DeWitt, pale and weak, stirred and turned his
head so that he could see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s good about it?&rdquo; he muttered with a trace
of his old spirit. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t even let me sit up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; smiled Penny. She sat down
in a chair beside the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all times to get laid up!&rdquo; the editor went on.
&ldquo;Heard from your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny shook her head. A long silence followed,
and then she said brightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll be found&mdash;probably today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. DeWitt lay with his eyes closed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
thinking&mdash;&rdquo; he mumbled drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Penny waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind&rsquo;s still fogged with that blamed ether,&rdquo; DeWitt
muttered. &ldquo;About your father&mdash;&rdquo; His voice
trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he could have been waylaid by enemies?&rdquo;
Penny asked after a moment. &ldquo;Mr. Schirr
believes his disappearance has a connection with the
tire-theft gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. DeWitt&rsquo;s eyes opened again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;
he mumbled. &ldquo;Your father was planning to break a
big story&mdash;didn&rsquo;t tell me much about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what evidence he carried in the
portfolio when he went to see the State Prosecutor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeWitt shook his head. &ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I reach him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he leave an address at the office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no way to reach him.&rdquo; Exhausted
from so much talking, DeWitt fell silent. At length
however, he aroused himself and asked: &ldquo;Have you
tried your father&rsquo;s safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Jerry&rsquo;s address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the names of the tire-theft gang. If the police
had something to work on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad took a lot of papers out just before he started
for the Prosecutor&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; Penny replied thoughtfully.
&ldquo;But some of the evidence may have been left.
It&rsquo;s worth investigating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse returned to the room with a vase for
the flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t allow you to remain much
longer,&rdquo; she said regretfully.</p>
<p>As she arose to go, Penny remembered to deliver
Old Charley&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s everything at the office?&rdquo; Mr. DeWitt
asked. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in charge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harley Schirr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. DeWitt&rsquo;s forehead wrinkled. &ldquo;Now I know
I&rsquo;ve got to roll out of here!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Things
will be in a nice state by the time I get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not wish to worry him. &ldquo;Oh, everything
will go along,&rdquo; she soothed. &ldquo;Mr. Schirr is very
efficient in his methods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And opinionated,&rdquo; muttered DeWitt. &ldquo;Oh, well,
I&rsquo;ll be back on the job in ten days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not disillusion him. Saying goodbye,
she returned to the newspaper office. Pausing at the
downstairs advertising department, she talked to Bud
Corbin, a close friend of Jerry&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the only address Jerry gave me,&rdquo; Mr. Corbin
said, taking a card from his billfold. &ldquo;A wire
might reach him. But there&rsquo;s a good chance it won&rsquo;t.
When he left here, he wasn&rsquo;t sure he&rsquo;d stop at Elk
Horn Lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grateful for the address, Penny composed a telegram
which the advertising man offered to send for
her. In the message she not only told of her father&rsquo;s
strange disappearance, but asked for a complete duplication
of material lost in the portfolio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I&rsquo;ve started the ball rolling,&rdquo; she thought,
with renewed hope in her efforts. &ldquo;I believe Jerry
can help if only he gets the wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny had not forgotten Mr. DeWitt&rsquo;s suggestion
that some evidence against the tire-theft gang might
be found in Mr. Parker&rsquo;s safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to open it while Dad is away,&rdquo; she reflected.
&ldquo;Still, I know the combination, and I&rsquo;m sure he would
want me to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To brave Harley Schirr a second time was a duty
not to Penny&rsquo;s liking. She debated waiting until
after four o&rsquo;clock when the editor doubtless would
leave the building. But time was precious and she
could not afford to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What am I, a coward?&rdquo; she prodded herself.
&ldquo;Why should I be afraid of Harley Schirr? When
Dad gets back on the job, he&rsquo;ll bounce him back
where he belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s reappearance in the newsroom created a
slight stir. However, no one spoke to her as she
walked straight to her father&rsquo;s office. The door was
closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Schirr isn&rsquo;t in conference?&rdquo; she asked one of
the copy readers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just go right on in,&rdquo; the man returned carelessly.</p>
<p>Without knocking, Penny opened the door. On
the threshold, she paused, startled. Harley Schirr was
down on his knees in front of the open safe. Evidently
he had been going through Mr. Parker&rsquo;s private
papers in systematic fashion for he was circled
by little piles of manila envelopes.</p>
<p>Mr. Schirr was even more startled than Penny. He
sprang to his feet, the picture of guilt. Then, recovering
his poise, he scowled and demanded: &ldquo;Here
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny carefully closed the office door before she
spoke. Then her words were terse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Schirr, kindly explain what you are doing in
my father&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for information about the tire-theft
gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A story you say the <i>Star</i> never should print.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there.&rdquo; A deep flush had
crept over Schirr&rsquo;s cheeks but his manner remained
confident. &ldquo;As editor I have to know what&rsquo;s going
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave you permission to open the safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that I am editor here, Miss Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I&rsquo;ve been reminded of it enough times,&rdquo;
Penny retorted. &ldquo;How did you learn the combination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw the numbers written on Dad&rsquo;s desk,&rdquo;
Penny accused.</p>
<p>Mr. Schirr did not deny the charge. Turning his
back, he started to remove a rubber band from a small
stack of yellowed letters. The act infuriated Penny,
for she recognized the packet. Years before, the letters
had been written by her own mother, and Mr.
Parker always had treasured them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you touch those!&rdquo; she cried, darting forward.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re personal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snatching the packet from Mr. Schirr, she gathered
up the other papers and envelopes from the floor.
Thrusting everything into the safe, she closed and
locked the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; commented the editor scathingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re through here!&rdquo; said Penny, facing him with
blazing eyes. &ldquo;Do you understand? I&rsquo;m discharging
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Schirr looked stunned. Then he laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So <i>you&rsquo;re</i> discharging me,&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;By what
right may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my father&rsquo;s plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make you the editor or
the owner, Miss Penelope Parker. You&rsquo;re a minor as
well as a nuisance. If your father proves to be dead,
the court will step in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; cried Penny, fighting to keep back the
tears. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care about Dad, or anything but
your own selfish interests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re hysterical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s anger subsided, to be replaced by a cool
determination that Harley Schirr should not remain
in charge of the <i>Star</i> another hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant just what I said,&rdquo; she told him quietly.
&ldquo;Please go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schirr smiled grimly. Seating himself at the desk,
his eyes challenged hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remain as editor here,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;If you
wish to contest my right, take your case to court.
In the meantime, keep out of my private office.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">10</span>
<br /><i>TALE OF A GHOST</i></h2>
<p>Beaten and close to tears, Penny stumbled out
of Harley Schirr&rsquo;s office. As she paused just beyond
the closed door, every eye in the newsroom focused
upon her. Salt Sommers, camera box slung over his
shoulder, went over and spoke to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, we all heard that row. If you say the
word, we&rsquo;ll walk out of here in a body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny smiled, touched by the expression of loyalty.
&ldquo;That would do no good,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Thanks just
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re through taking orders from Schirr!&rdquo; Salt
went on. &ldquo;He always has been a pain in the neck,
and now that he has authority, there&rsquo;s no holding him
down. How about it, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chorus of approval greeted his words. One of
the reporters picked up a paper weight and would
have hurled it against the closed door, had not another
restrained him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Dad would want everyone to carry on,&rdquo;
Penny said quietly. &ldquo;The paper must be published
the same as always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could do our work and do it well, if Schirr
would just leave us alone,&rdquo; growled one of the copy
readers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; added another. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
take over, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Schirr just reminded me that I&rsquo;m not the editor.
I know nothing about running a newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the time you ran the High School
weekly?&rdquo; Salt reminded her. &ldquo;Why, you did a bang
up job of it, and uncovered <i>The Secret Pact</i> story to
boot! Don&rsquo;t try to tell us you don&rsquo;t know how to
run a newspaper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A weekly high school sheet and the <i>Star</i> are two
different propositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your father has a fine organization here,&rdquo; Salt
argued. &ldquo;If Schirr can be kept from breaking it up,
everything will go along. The boys all know their
jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s eyes began to sparkle. But she said: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see how I could take over, much as I would like
to do it. Schirr has staked out rights in Dad&rsquo;s office
and nothing will move him short of a court order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a fancy office to run a paper,&rdquo;
Salt grinned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just take our orders from you.
Schirr can sit until he&rsquo;s had enough of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Penny gazed at the eager, loyal faces about her.
Nearly all of the men were old employees, personally
trained by her father and Mr. DeWitt. She knew
she could depend on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;As your
new editor, I wish to issue my first order. Please,
let&rsquo;s not publish any more sensational stories about
Dad&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay Chief,&rdquo; grinned one of the desk men. &ldquo;That
suits us all fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was given a seat of honor at the slot of the
circular copy desk. There she was able to read and
pass upon every story which flowed from the typewriters
of the various reporters. With the courteous
help of one of the deskmen, she remade the front page
of the noon edition. A particularly sensational story
about Mr. Parker, prepared earlier in the day, was
promptly &ldquo;busted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny found her new duties exacting, but surprisingly
easy. Over the years it was astonishing how
much she had learned about the workings of a newspaper
plant. At different times she had served as reporter,
society editor and special feature writer. As
for the editorial policy of the <i>Star</i>, she was thoroughly
familiar with it, for her father frequently aired his
views at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Shortly after the noon edition rolled from the press,
the buzzer in Mr. Schirr&rsquo;s office sounded. Mr. Parker&rsquo;s
private secretary did not answer. The buzzer
kept on for nearly five minutes. Then the door was
flung open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the blazes is the matter with everyone?&rdquo;
Schirr shouted.</p>
<p>His gaze fastened upon Penny at the copy desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet our new editor, Mr. Schirr,&rdquo; said Salt, who
had that moment come out of the camera room.</p>
<p>Schirr ignored Penny. Snatching up one of the
noon editions, still fresh with wet ink, he glanced at
the front page. His eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eckert,&rdquo; he said to the head copy man, &ldquo;come into
my office. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; said Eckert, but he did not follow
Schirr into the adjoining room.</p>
<p>Soon the ex-editor came storming out to learn what
was wrong. This time his expression was baffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Eckert,&rdquo; he said with exaggerated politeness.
&ldquo;Will you please step into my office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; replied the copy reader. &ldquo;You may as
well know right now that you&rsquo;re not giving the orders
around here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that!&rdquo; cried Schirr.</p>
<p>Darting to one of the speaking tubes, he called the
foreman of the press room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schirr talking!&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;Stop the presses!
Kill that noon edition! We&rsquo;re making over the front
page!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hear you,&rdquo; was the reply, for word had been
passed to the men in the pressroom. &ldquo;Louder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schirr shouted until he was nearly hoarse. Then
suddenly conscious that he was making a spectacle of
himself, he slammed into his office. A minute later
he reappeared, hat jammed low over his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very clever scheme, Miss Parker,&rdquo; he
said, facing her. &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t work. I&rsquo;m leaving,
but I&rsquo;ll be back. With a lawyer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode from the newsroom, banging the door so
hard the glass rattled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that egg,&rdquo; Salt advised Penny.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mostly bluff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he does mean to get a court order,&rdquo; she
returned soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may try,&rdquo; Salt shrugged. &ldquo;We can handle
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Schirr&rsquo;s departure, everything moved
smoothly at the <i>Star</i> plant. One edition after another
rolled from the presses. Penny was kept busy, and
frequently she was worried and in doubt. Nevertheless,
everyone made the way easy for her, and as the
day wore on she gained confidence.</p>
<p>Throughout the afternoon, news stories kept pouring
into the <i>Star</i> office, but no encouraging information
came in regard to Mr. Parker. Several times
Penny called the police station and also talked with
Mrs. Weems. The housekeeper, fearful that the girl
would become ill, insisted upon bringing a hot evening
meal to the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, you&rsquo;ve been here all day,&rdquo; she chided anxiously.
&ldquo;You must come home with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just yet,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too
much to do. By tomorrow, if Schirr doesn&rsquo;t make
trouble, things will smooth out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re working so hard you&rsquo;ll be sick abed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to work,&rdquo; Penny said grimly. &ldquo;It keeps
me from thinking. Anyway, Dad would want me to
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems sighed as she gathered up the lunch
basket and thermos bottle. Penny barely had tasted
the food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you be home?&rdquo; the housekeeper asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say exactly. After the night editions are
out. Don&rsquo;t sit up for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I couldn&rsquo;t go to bed until you are
home,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems responded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take a taxi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; promised Penny.</p>
<p>After the housekeeper had gone, she plunged into
her duties once more. With the force short of two
men, DeWitt and Schirr, there really was too much
work for the desk men to do unassisted. Penny wrote
headlines, copy-read stories, and passed on all matters
of policy. So busy did she keep, that when at length
she glanced at her watch, it was eleven-thirty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;And Mrs. Weems will
be waiting up for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying goodnight to the men who would carry on
in her absence, she went down the back stairs to the
street. As she glanced about for a taxicab, she saw
Old Mose Johnson shuffling toward the loading dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; she greeted him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to
see you&rsquo;re ahead of time tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;, Miss Penny,&rdquo; the colored man said,
doffing his tattered hat. &ldquo;Yas&rsquo;m. I&rsquo;se heah, but I seed
dat same ghost a-lurkin&rsquo; behind de gate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that ghost isn&rsquo;t becoming a habit with you,
Mose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deed Miss Penny, he&rsquo;s mo&rsquo; dan a habit,&rdquo; the colored
man sighed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a suah-nuff live ghost. De
fust time I seed him I thought he wasn&rsquo;t no imagination
ghost. But when I saw him agin&rsquo; tonight I was
dead suah of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened this time, Mose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Penny, I was a walking along dat same
road, down by de ole Harrison place when I seed him
again. He was a-cavortin&rsquo; behind dat same iron gate.
And he was dressed de same too, in a long white robe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you ran the same too, I suppose?&rdquo; smiled
Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah made myself scarce around dat gate, but I
didn&rsquo;t run home dis time. I was a-skeered of mah ole
woman. I beats it to de restaurant on de co&rsquo;ner and
waits dere &rsquo;till a bus comes. Oh, I&rsquo;se gettin&rsquo; good,
Miss Penny! I can see a ghost and git to work on
time, all de same evenin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, keep up the good work,&rdquo; Penny said jokingly
as she turned away.</p>
<p>The meeting with Old Mose had served to divert
the girl&rsquo;s mind from her own difficulties. Riding
home by taxi, she caught herself reviewing the details
of the colored man&rsquo;s outlandish tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mose couldn&rsquo;t have seen a ghost,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;but he&rsquo;s honest about being frightened. If I didn&rsquo;t
have so many serious troubles, I&rsquo;d be tempted to investigate
the old Harrison estate myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny alighted at her home and walked wearily up
the shoveled path. Snow was falling once more.
Already the exposed porch was covered with a half-inch
coating of feathery flakes.</p>
<p>Inside the house a light flashed on. The bright
beam shining through the window drew Penny&rsquo;s attention
to a series of freshly-made footprints criss-crossing
the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems must have had a visitor,&rdquo; she thought,
observing that the heel marks were made by a woman&rsquo;s
shoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>As Penny reached for the door knob, her glance
fell upon a long, narrow envelope which protruded
from the tin mailbox. She removed it, wondering
why the housekeeper had neglected to do so.</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, you&rsquo;re home at last, Penny. I
fell asleep on the davenport. There isn&rsquo;t any word&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a scrap of news,&rdquo; Penny completed.</p>
<p>Dropping the letter on the center table, she removed
her wraps and flung herself full length on the
davenport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child!&rdquo; Mrs. Weems murmured.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re practically exhausted. Please go straight to
bed. I&rsquo;ll fix some warm milk and perhaps you can
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel as if I&rsquo;d ever sleep again,&rdquo; Penny declared.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, but I feel so excited and tense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems picked up the girl&rsquo;s coat and cap.
Shaking them free of snow, she hung the garments in
the closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have a bad time of it today?&rdquo; Penny
asked after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly pleasant,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems replied.
&ldquo;Reporters and photographers came from every paper
in Riverview. The police too&mdash;although I was glad
to have them. And the telephone! I counted twelve
calls in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be dead. You shouldn&rsquo;t have waited up
for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to, Penny. About an hour ago I thought
I heard your step on the porch, but I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sat up. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had a caller during
the last hour, Mrs. Weems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve been alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I saw footprints on the porch! And I found
this in the mailbox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny snatched the long envelope from the table.
Holding it beneath the bridge lamp, she noticed for
the first time that it bore no stamp. Strangely, it was
addressed to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where did you get that letter?&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Weems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found it in the mailbox.&rdquo; Penny&rsquo;s hand trembled
as she ripped open the flap.</p>
<p>A sheet of writing paper, high quality and slightly
perfumed, slid from the envelope. The message was
terse and bore no signature at the end. It read:</p>
<div class="bq">
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Offer a suitable reward and information will be
provided as to the whereabouts of your father. Make
your offer known in the <i>Star</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">11</span>
<br /><i>BY A CEMETERY WALL</i></h2>
<p>Penny and Mrs. Weems reread the anonymous
message many times, analyzing every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plainly this note was written by a woman of some
means for the paper is fine quality,&rdquo; Penny commented.
&ldquo;She must have sneaked up on the porch
about an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call the police at once,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Weems.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll tell us what we should do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever left the note may be watching the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must risk that, Penny. I&rsquo;ll call the station
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Mrs. Weems busied herself at the telephone,
Penny switched off the living-room light. She could
see no one loitering anywhere near the house. Slipping
on her coat, she went outside to inspect the footprints
left on the porch. Only a few remained uncovered
by snow. There was no way to tell in which
direction the writer of the anonymous message had
gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Mrs. Weems had completed her telephone call by
the time Penny reentered the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two detectives will be here in a few minutes,&rdquo;
she revealed. &ldquo;You keep watch for them while I run
upstairs and get into something more suitable than a
lounging robe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within ten minutes a car drew up in front of the
house. Penny already was acquainted with Detectives
Dick Brandon and George Fuller, and had great confidence
in their judgment. Anxiously she and Mrs.
Weems waited while the men scanned the anonymous
message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This might be only a crank note,&rdquo; commented
Brandon. &ldquo;Someone who&rsquo;s read of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s disappearance,
and hopes to pick up a little cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think it came from the tire-theft
gang?&rdquo; Penny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely. A professional kidnaper never would
have sent a note like this. The handwriting hasn&rsquo;t
even been disguised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it be possible to trace the person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be if we have a little luck.&rdquo; Detective
Brandon pocketed the letter. &ldquo;Now this is what you
must do, Miss Parker. Offer a reward&mdash;say five thousand
dollars&mdash;for information about your father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the story in every edition of the <i>Star</i> tomorrow.
And then what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll likely hear from the writer of this anonymous
message, either by letter or telephone. If you
contact the woman, arrange a meeting. Then notify
us immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discussion went on. When at length the two
detectives left, Penny and Mrs. Weems were hopeful
that within another twenty-four hours they might
know Mr. Parker&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>In the morning, after only five hours of sleep, Penny
was back at her desk. Her first act was to dictate the
story offering a five-thousand-dollar reward for information
about her father. Not even to Salt Sommers
did she confide that she had received an anonymous
message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s going well here at the plant,&rdquo; he assured
her. &ldquo;Harley Schirr hasn&rsquo;t so much as stuck
his nose through the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;re through with him,&rdquo; replied Penny
soberly. &ldquo;However, I don&rsquo;t feel that we are. By the
way, no telegram has come from Jerry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No message yet. Guess he didn&rsquo;t get your wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the morning, Penny worked tirelessly
at her desk. Although her father&rsquo;s office now was
vacant, she did not take possession. Even when she
occasionally entered to get papers from the file, it
gave her a queer, tight feeling. Her father&rsquo;s old neck-scarf
still hung on the clothes tree. The rubbers he
hated to wear stood heel to heel against the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad is alive and well,&rdquo; she told herself whenever
her courage faltered. &ldquo;By tomorrow he&rsquo;ll be back.
I know he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon Salt brought Penny a sandwich which she
ate without leaving her desk. As she struggled with
the last mouthful, the telephone rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Miss Parker?&rdquo; inquired a woman&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Penny gripped the receiver tightly. Her pulse began
to pound. Although she had no real reason for
thinking so, she suddenly knew that she was in contact
with the mysterious writer of the anonymous message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, keeping her voice calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You offered a reward in your paper today. Five
thousand dollars for information about Mr. Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. Can you tell me anything about his disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can if you&rsquo;re willing to pay the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no questions asked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No questions,&rdquo; Penny promised. &ldquo;If you actually
can provide information that will help me find my
father, I&rsquo;ll be happy to give you the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence. Fearful lest the woman
had lost her nerve and was about to hang up, Penny
said anxiously:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I meet you? Will you come to my
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too risky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where shall I meet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight at eight. You know the cemetery out on
Baldiff Road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baldiff Road?&rdquo; Penny repeated doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it on a county map,&rdquo; the woman instructed.
&ldquo;Meet me at the cemetery wall promptly
at eight. And don&rsquo;t bring anyone with you. Just
the money. I&rsquo;ll guarantee to tell you where you can
find your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The receiver clicked.</p>
<p>Greatly excited, Penny made a futile attempt to
trace the telephone call. Failing, she set off for the
police station to talk to Detectives Fuller and Brandon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman must be a rank amateur or she
wouldn&rsquo;t have arranged a meeting in the way she did!&rdquo;
Detective Brandon assured Penny. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s find
out where Baldiff Road is located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using a large map, he circled an area several miles
south of Riverview. Penny was surprised to note
that Baldiff Road branched off from the same deserted
thoroughfare which she and Louise had followed on
the night of the blizzard. The cemetery, Oakland
Hills, was situated perhaps a mile from the old Harrison
place where Mose Johnson had claimed to have
seen a ghost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to nab the woman when she
shows up,&rdquo; Detective Fuller declared. &ldquo;Dick and I
will get there early and keep watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what am I to do?&rdquo; Penny inquired. &ldquo;Shall I
take the reward money with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you a package of fake money,&rdquo; the detective
answered. &ldquo;Drive to the cemetery alone at
the appointed hour. If the woman shows up, talk to
her, try to learn what she knows. We&rsquo;ll attend to
the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny returned home to consult with Mrs. Weems.
How to reach the cemetery was something of a problem.
Her own car, minus its wheels, remained at the
Yacht Club, and Mr. Parker&rsquo;s automobile had been
hauled to a garage for extensive repairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you borrow a car from someone at the <i>Star</i>
office?&rdquo; suggested the housekeeper. &ldquo;And do take a
man with you when you drive to the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I must go alone,&rdquo; insisted Penny. &ldquo;That part
is very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end she was able to borrow Salt Sommer&rsquo;s
coupe. A little after seven o&rsquo;clock she set off for
Baldiff Road with the package of fake money in her
possession. The night was not cold, but a stiff wind
blew through the evergreens; whirlwinds of snow
chased one another across the untraveled road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dreary place for a meeting,&rdquo; Penny shivered
as she glimpsed the bleak cemetery on a hilltop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>The area, a full half-mile from any house, was
bounded by a high snow-covered brick wall. Beyond
the barrier, starlight revealed a cluster of rounding
tombstones layered with white. No one was visible,
neither the woman nor members of the police force.</p>
<p>Penny glanced at her watch. It lacked ten minutes
of eight o&rsquo;clock. She parked not far from the cemetery
entrance and switched off the engine.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes elapsed. Nervous and cold, Penny
climbed from the car and tramped back and forth to
restore circulation. She had begun to doubt that the
woman would keep the appointment.</p>
<p>Then, coming swiftly down the road, she saw a
strange looking figure. The one who approached
wore a long, tight-fitting coat. A hat with a dark
veil covered the woman&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; thought Penny, every nerve tense.</p>
<p>The woman came closer. While still some distance
from the cemetery entrance, she suddenly paused.
Her head jerked sideways. Then to Penny&rsquo;s dismay,
she turned and fled toward the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Penny shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!
Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman paid no heed. Lifting her coat the better
to run, she disappeared among the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">12</span>
<br /><i>FLIGHT</i></h2>
<p>As Penny wondered what to do, Detectives
Brandon and Fuller leaped from their hiding place
behind the cemetery wall. Their car had been secreted
in a clump of bushes farther down the road.
By pure mischance, the woman in the black veil had
seen it as she approached, and fearing treachery, had
fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Dick, or she&rsquo;ll get away!&rdquo; Fuller shouted.</p>
<p>Penny did not join in the pursuit. Reentering her
car, she waited anxiously. From the crashing of underbrush,
she knew the detectives were having difficulty
in following the woman. In the dark forest it
would be very easy for her to elude the officers.</p>
<p>Three quarters of an hour elapsed before the men
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost her,&rdquo; Detective Brandon reported. &ldquo;No
use searching any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Sick at heart, Penny drove slowly toward home.
Her hopes had been completely dashed. Not only
had she failed to contact the mysterious woman, but
there now seemed little likelihood of doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may receive another telephone message,&rdquo; she
thought, &ldquo;but I doubt it. That woman probably will
be too badly frightened to try to contact me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the exit of Baldiff Road, Penny headed down
the winding hillside highway which she and Louise
had followed on the night of the blizzard. The route,
although slightly longer, would take her close to the
Riverview Yacht Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go that way and see if my car is still there,&rdquo;
she decided. &ldquo;Then tomorrow I can have it hauled
home and jacked up. I should have looked after the
matter long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coupe rounded a curve and the road dipped
between an avenue of swaying, whispering pines. To
the left, shrouded in snow, loomed the old Harrison
house. The estate was picturesque in itself, and Mose
Johnson&rsquo;s tale about a ghost had intensified the girl&rsquo;s
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who owns the place now?&rdquo; she speculated.
&ldquo;Probably not any member of the Harrison
family, as I believe they were old-timers in Riverview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny slowed the car to idling speed. Deliberately
keeping to the left hand side of the road, she studied
with deep interest the long, snow-frosted fence which
bounded the grounds. The barrier was an unfriendly
one, high and spiked at the top.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Suddenly her attention focused upon a well-beaten
path in the snow just inside the fence. The footprints,
plainly visible in the bright moonlight, extended
the full width of the grounds.</p>
<p>Into Penny&rsquo;s mind flashed the wild yarn told by
Mose Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost tracks!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;At least those prints
must have been made by whatever he saw beyond the
gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So interested was Penny in the path that for an instant
she completely forgot her driving. The front
left wheel of the car struck a tiny mound of ice and
snow at the road&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>Barely in time to avoid an accident, the girl twisted
the steering wheel and brought the car back on the
highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another second and I&rsquo;d have been in the ditch!&rdquo;
she thought shakily. &ldquo;If I must look for a ghost,
guess I&rsquo;ll do the job right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny pulled up, this time at the opposite side of
the road. Getting out, she crossed to the iron fence
and peered through it. The path which had attracted
her attention had been pounded hard by someone who
had walked just inside the enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd!&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;Maybe Old Mose&rsquo;s ghost
has more substance than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Penny glanced toward the big house, dark and majestic
in its setting of evergreens. Obviously the place
had been closed for the winter. Walks were not
shoveled, blinds had been drawn, and no tire tracks
led to and from the three-car garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who or what could have made that
path?&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Certainly not an animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to solve the mystery, Penny turned to re-enter
the parked coupe. Before she could cross the
road, a light went on in a third floor room of the
estate house. Startled, she stared at it. As she
watched, it was extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone must live here!&rdquo; thought Penny. &ldquo;Or
am I seeing spooks myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long while she watched the upper floor of
the house. The light did not reappear. At length,
wearying of the vigil, she returned to the car.</p>
<p>Penny started the engine and bent down to open
the fins of the heater. Straightening, she cast a last,
careless glance toward the old estate. Her heart did
a flip-flop.</p>
<p>Beyond the iron gate, in the garden area, a white-robed
figure slowly paced back and forth!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Aunt!&rdquo; whispered Penny. &ldquo;Am I seeing
things or am I seeing things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she sat very straight, watching. The
ghostly figure, white from head to toe, moved with
measured steps toward the high gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any ghosts,&rdquo; she encouraged herself.
&ldquo;But if that&rsquo;s not a spook, it must be someone dressed
up like one! And who would play Hallowe&rsquo;en games
on a cold night like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone, frankly nervous, Penny had no overpowering
desire to investigate the white-robed figure at
close range. A large, spreading evergreen half-blocked
her view of the gate. She could not see the
ghost plainly, but she distinctly heard the rattle of a
chain as the apparition tested the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real or imaginary, that spook is trying to get out!&rdquo;
Penny thought with a shiver. &ldquo;If Mose were here
now I&rsquo;d challenge him to a race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white-gowned figure shook the gate chain a
second time, then slowly retreated. Penny watched
for a moment, before abruptly swinging open the car
door. She had decided to investigate.</p>
<p>As she crossed the road, the white figure moved
away from her. By the time she reached the gate, it
had disappeared around a corner of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least Mr. Spook wasn&rsquo;t carrying his own tombstone!&rdquo;
Penny observed to herself. &ldquo;Mose exaggerated
that part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited, leaning against the gate post. Within
three minutes a light went on in the upper part of the
house. For a fleeting instant before the blind was
pulled, she saw someone standing in front of an old-fashioned
dresser.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ghost seemingly has turned in for the night,&rdquo;
thought Penny. &ldquo;But is it a he, she, or it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the bedroom light was extinguished. Cold
and tired, Penny decided that the mystery must remain
unsolved. However, as she drove on, she kept thinking
about what she had seen. Of one thing she now
was certain. The estate was not deserted!</p>
<p>Without stopping at the Yacht Club grounds,
Penny made certain that her stripped car and ice boat
remained as she last had seen them. Driving on to
Riverview, she left Salt&rsquo;s car at the <i>Star</i> plant, then
taxied home to tell Mrs. Weems of her failure at the
cemetery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel badly about it,&rdquo; the housekeeper comforted.
&ldquo;Surely the woman who telephoned will
make another attempt to reach you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Penny replied gloomily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll know
now that the police are watching for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This entire affair is so bewildering,&rdquo; sighed Mrs.
Weems. &ldquo;How could your father have been kidnaped?
If what we&rsquo;ve learned is true, he left the
scene of the accident of his own free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was so baffled in my life,&rdquo; Penny returned,
throwing herself on the davenport. &ldquo;I used to think
I was good at solving puzzles. Now I know I&rsquo;m just
plain dumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought about employing a private detective?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might be a good idea!&rdquo; Penny agreed, encouraged.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she started wearily up the stairs to bed, Mrs.
Weems called after her to say that Louise Sidell had
telephoned earlier in the evening. Penny nodded absently,
assuming that her chum had phoned to express
sympathy. She did not think of the matter again until
the next morning at breakfast. As she was leaving
the table, Mrs. Weems came in to report that Louise
once more was on the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I can&rsquo;t tell you how shocked I was to learn
about your father,&rdquo; her chum began breathlessly. &ldquo;Is
there anything I can do to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you using for a car? You must need
one badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt Sommers let me have his last night. I&rsquo;ll get
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, I know how you can buy tires!&rdquo; Louise
went on. &ldquo;In fact, that&rsquo;s what I wanted to talk to
you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I buy tires? Rubber is supposed to be
scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was having my hair fixed at the beauty
parlor yesterday I heard two women talking!&rdquo; Louise
declared excitedly. &ldquo;It seems there&rsquo;s a garage where
you can get them if you pull the right strings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! A Black Market place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s what you would call it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get tires illegally,&rdquo; Penny said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested, Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even care to know the name of the
garage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good would it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None perhaps, but it might give you a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A surprise?&rdquo; Penny repeated. She glanced at the
clock, impatient because the conversation was being
prolonged. A great deal of important work awaited
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to know the name of the place?&rdquo;
Louise persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. On second thought, it might be well
worth while to find out what I can about Black
Market operations in tires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conviction had come suddenly to Penny that
all the evidence contained in her father&rsquo;s lost portfolio
must be gathered anew. No word had been received
from Jerry Livingston. In the quest for information,
she must depend upon her own efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to give you a real shock to learn the
name of the place,&rdquo; Louise went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shock proof by this time,&rdquo; answered Penny.
&ldquo;Let &rsquo;er fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Louise was unwilling to divulge the information
over the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare tell you now,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Just sit
tight for ten minutes and I&rsquo;ll deliver my bombshell in
person.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">13</span>
<br /><i>A BLACK MARKET</i></h2>
<p>Ten minutes later Louise was at the front door
with the Sidell family car. She tooted the horn until
Penny put on her coat and went outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in and I&rsquo;ll take you to the place of mystery,&rdquo;
Louise greeted her. &ldquo;On second thought, you&rsquo;d better
drive. I hate icy roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny slid behind the steering wheel. &ldquo;But where
are we going?&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Honestly, Lou, I
haven&rsquo;t much time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mattie Williams&rsquo; garage is the place that sells the
tires! Now, are you interested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I? Why, we stopped there with Salt Sommers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did indeed. Remember the big truck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou, you may have stumbled into something really
important!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you think so, chum. But you&rsquo;re not interested
in Black Markets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind! I want to talk to Mattie
Williams right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny started the car. Driving with a mechanical,
unthinking efficiency born of many years&rsquo; practice,
she questioned Louise as to the source of her information.
The girls were deep in a discussion when they
heard someone shout. Salt Sommers had hailed them
from the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello,&rdquo; Penny greeted him, stopping the car
with a jerk. &ldquo;Any trouble at the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from Schirr,&rdquo; grinned Salt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hot-footing
it to the Ladies Club to mug some dames pouring tea!
For the society page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Salt!&rdquo; smiled Penny, knowing how he hated
trivial assignments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your way to the office?&rdquo; the photographer
questioned.</p>
<p>Penny hesitated, then decided to confide in Salt.
She repeated what Louise had told her about the Mattie
Williams&rsquo; garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, can you beat that!&rdquo; the photographer exclaimed.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Mattie and her partner well,
but I always supposed they were honest. So they&rsquo;re
dealing in stolen tires!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know for sure,&rdquo; Penny said hastily.
&ldquo;Our information is mostly founded on rumor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the tires may not be stolen ones,&rdquo; contributed
Louise. &ldquo;I only heard they can be bought there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Penny added that she would not take time to run
down the Black Market story save that her father&rsquo;s
disappearance might have a connection with the tire-thief
gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I aim to learn the names of those men Dad intended
to expose,&rdquo; she said earnestly.</p>
<p>Somewhat startled by the grim note of Penny&rsquo;s
voice, Salt warned her that she might be venturing on
dangerous ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all admire your courage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you
mustn&rsquo;t take foolish risks. Your father would turn
thumbs down on that idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of Dad that I must investigate every
angle of the tire-theft racket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite an ambitious assignment,&rdquo; Salt said dryly.
&ldquo;Now as soon as Jerry gets back from Canada&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait! Something has to be done right
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how you feel,&rdquo; responded Salt, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s
such a thing as being too courageous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not courageous,&rdquo; Penny denied. &ldquo;Last night
at the cemetery I was scared half to death. And then
when I saw the ghost&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ghost?&rdquo; interrupted Louise.</p>
<p>Penny had not intended to speak of what she had
seen at the Harrison estate. The slip of tongue made
it necessary to tell of the path by the gate, the retreating
figure, and the mysterious light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; commented the photographer, regarding
her with a peculiar expression. &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve
been on duty at the observation tower I&rsquo;ve never seen
any activity at the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts, but I saw one all that
same!&rdquo; Penny insisted. &ldquo;Just watch some night and
see for yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annoyed by Salt&rsquo;s smile, she shifted gears and drove
on down the street. Turning to Louise, she asked
earnestly: &ldquo;You believe I saw something wandering
about the estate last night, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Louise hesitated, unwilling to offend her
chum. &ldquo;You must have been quite upset after failing
to meet that woman at the cemetery. Under the circumstances....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was as calm as I am now,&rdquo; Penny cried indignantly.
&ldquo;I saw it, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you did, dear,&rdquo; Louise soothed. &ldquo;Do
please watch your driving more carefully, or I&rsquo;ll have
to take over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny suddenly relaxed. &ldquo;Okay, have it your own
way,&rdquo; she shrugged. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t believe Mose Johnson,
so why should you believe me? It&rsquo;s just one of
those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long while they rode in silence. Few cars
were on the road and there was little business activity
at Kamm&rsquo;s Corner. Penny parked in front of the
Mattie Williams&rsquo; garage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What excuse will we have for questioning her?&rdquo;
Louise asked dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to make an excuse,&rdquo; said Penny.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just come right out and ask her if she sells tires
without a special order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls entered the warm little office, stamping
snow from their galoshes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; called a voice which belonged to
Mattie Williams.</p>
<p>The garage owner was busy with a customer.
Soon however, she came in from the main part of the
building, wiping her oily hands on a piece of waste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; she inquired briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember us, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Penny, leading
into the subject of tires as gradually as possible.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re friends of Salt Sommers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo; the woman&rsquo;s face lighted. &ldquo;You came
in with him the night of the bad storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My car had been stripped of its tires. Ever since,
I&rsquo;ve been wondering how to get new ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slightly guarded expression came over Mattie
Williams&rsquo; face. She said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told I might obtain some here,&rdquo; Penny
plunged on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; said Mattie. &ldquo;Provided you have an
order from your Ration Board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Mattie gazed at Penny with undisguised scorn.
&ldquo;What sort of a place do you think we run here?&rdquo;
she demanded. &ldquo;Of course we don&rsquo;t sell tires without
an order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were told&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were told wrong,&rdquo; snapped Mattie.
&ldquo;Sorry. I can&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up a wrench from the desk top, the woman
left the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I didn&rsquo;t approach her the right way,&rdquo; remarked
Penny sadly. &ldquo;Either that, or our information
was incorrect. Louise, are you sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am!&rdquo; her chum insisted. &ldquo;The two women
I overheard, distinctly said Mattie Williams&rsquo; garage.
Of course, they might have been wrong about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny and Louise could leave the office, a
middle-aged man with glasses came in through the
street door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam Burkholder here?&rdquo; he demanded, warming
himself by the stove.</p>
<p>Penny started to say that she did not know. Just
then Mattie Williams&rsquo; partner came in the other door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Sam!&rdquo; the stranger greeted him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the
car parked around back. Are you ready to put on
that tire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam frowned, darting a quick glance at the two
girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the one I patched for you!&rdquo; he returned.
&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s fixed. Drive your car in the back entrance
and I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men went out into the main part of the garage.
Just beyond the door they paused for a whispered
conference, then separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; inquired Louise, glancing at her
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yet,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m curious to see
that patched tire. Let&rsquo;s kill a little more time here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pretending to warm themselves by the stove, they
waited ten minutes. Then, without attracting attention,
they sauntered out onto the main garage floor.
Mattie Williams was busy washing a car and did not
see them.</p>
<p>The garage workroom was divided into sections,
separated by a double door which was closed. Penny
strolled over and pushed it open just enough to see
through the crack.</p>
<p>Sam Burkholder was working on the stranger&rsquo;s car.
He had removed an old tire and wheel, and was replacing
it with one whose tread appeared new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A patched tire, my left eye!&rdquo; Penny whispered to
Louise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as we thought! This garage must
be a Black Market place!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">14</span>
<br /><i>A FAMILIAR FIGURE</i></h2>
<p>Only for a moment did the girls dare remain at
the door watching Sam Burkholder mount the tire.
Then, their curiosity satisfied, they moved quietly
away. Without speaking to Mattie Williams, they
returned to the parked automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wasn&rsquo;t I right?&rdquo; Louise demanded triumphantly.
&ldquo;What do you think we should do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question plagued Penny. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she
confessed. &ldquo;If only we were absolutely sure the tire
was new&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looked new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it could have had some wear. It&rsquo;s possible,
too, that the customer had a legal right to buy a
new tire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t intend to report to the police,
Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to Salt about it first. We must
move carefully, Lou. You see, my main objective is
to learn the names of the higher-ups involved in the
tire-theft racket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where does this garage fit into the picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it fits at all, my guess is that Sam and Mattie are
buying illegal tires&mdash;perhaps from the same men who
stripped my car and threatened Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driving slowly toward Riverview, Penny reviewed
what she had seen. She was convinced the information
was valuable, yet she scarcely knew how to
use it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Salt suggests that I report to the police, that&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she decided.</p>
<p>Enroute home, Penny stopped at another garage
to make arrangements to have her stripped coupe
hauled into the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the <i>Icicle</i>?&rdquo; Louise asked, thinking her
chum had forgotten the iceboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will have to stay where it is for the time being,&rdquo;
Penny replied. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s stolen, I won&rsquo;t much care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Sidell home, the girls separated. Thanking
Louise for the use of the car, Penny returned afoot to
the <i>Star</i> office. Salt Sommers was absent on assignment,
so she did not linger long. As she rounded a
street corner on her way home, a newsboy for a rival
paper blocked her path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read all about it!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Anthony Parker
Believed Kidnaped! Paper, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Penny dropped a coin into the lad&rsquo;s hand and
hastily scanned the front page. The story of her
father&rsquo;s disappearance was a highly colored account,
but contained not a useful item of information. Tossing
the sheet into a street paper-container, she
moved on.</p>
<p>She was passing the Gillman Department Store
when her attention was drawn to a woman who
waited for a bus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her somewhere before,&rdquo; thought Penny,
pausing. &ldquo;Last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman wore a small black hat and a long, old-fashioned
dark coat which came nearly to her ankles.
It was the shape of the garment and its unusual length
which struck Penny as familiar. Why, the woman
resembled the one who had fled from the cemetery!</p>
<p>Penny pretended to gaze into the store window.
Actually she studied the woman from every angle.
She might have been forty-seven years of age and was
large-boned. Her face was heavily lined, and her long
hands were covered by a pair of cheap, black cotton
gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be the same woman?&rdquo; thought Penny in
perplexity.</p>
<p>A bus bearing a county placard glided up to the
curb. The woman in black was the only passenger to
board it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That bus goes out toward Baldiff Road and the
cemetery!&rdquo; Penny told herself. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where
I&rsquo;m going too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An instant before the folding doors slammed shut,
she sprang aboard. Paying her fare, she sought a seat
at the rear of the bus.</p>
<p>No sooner was the coach in motion than Penny regretted
her hasty action. What could she hope to
gain by pursuing the strange woman? She was not
certain enough of her identification to make a direct
accusation. County buses ran infrequently. In all
likelihood, she would find herself stranded in the
country.</p>
<p>Penny arose to leave the bus. Then changing her
mind a second time, she sat down. Try as she would,
she could not rid herself of a conviction that the
woman she followed was the same one who had visited
the cemetery.</p>
<p>The bus made few stops in the city. Once beyond
the city limits, it sped along at a brisk speed. To
Penny&rsquo;s satisfaction, the woman in black soon began
to gather up her packages. She pressed a button and
the bus skidded to a stop at a crossroads.</p>
<p>With no show of haste, Penny followed the woman
from the bus. Pretending to enter a grocery store at
the corner, she waited and watched.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Apparently the woman lived nearby, for she started
off down a narrow, winding road which ran at right
angles to the main highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s the road that runs past the Harrison
place,&rdquo; Penny thought. &ldquo;Wonder if she can be going
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waiting until the woman was nearly out of sight,
she trudged after her. Walking was difficult for the
road had not been cleared by a snow plow. Fortunately
for Penny, the woman did not once glance
behind her. She kept steadily on until she came
within view of the big estate house on the hill. Just
before she reached the boundary fence, she cut across
a field, approaching the dwelling from the rear.</p>
<p>Penny remained at the road, watching. The woman
took a key from her pocket, unlocking a small, padlocked
gate at the rear of the grounds. She snapped
the lock shut again, and disappeared into the house.</p>
<p>Penny perched herself on top of an old-fashioned
rail fence to think over what she had seen. The
woman, whoever she was, obviously lived at the estate.
Yet the cheap quality of her clothing suggested
that she could not be the owner of such an expensive
establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a servant or caretaker,&rdquo; Penny reasoned.
&ldquo;But is she the one who ran away last night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Far over the hills in a lonely grove of pines stood
Oakland Cemetery. On either side of Baldiff Road
stretched dense woods, a growth that crept to the very
boundaries of the Harrison estate. Penny instantly
noted that it would be possible for a person to flee
from the cemetery to the very door of the estate without
once leaving the shelter of trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was the same woman!&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;If she lives here, it would be logical for her to specify
Oakland Cemetery as a meeting place! And escape
would be easy for her, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny slid down from the fence. It would do no
good to question the woman. Rather, if she were
guilty, questions might serve to place her on the alert.
Far better, she reasoned, to bide her time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll learn everything I can about that woman,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;Tonight I&rsquo;ll watch the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In making her plans, Penny did not take into account
Mrs. Weems&rsquo; attitude. Upon reaching home
late in the afternoon, she found the housekeeper in a
most discouraged mood. No favorable news had been
received from any source.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worried about you too, Penny,&rdquo; Mrs.
Weems confessed. &ldquo;Where did you go after you left
the <i>Star</i> office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny told of her trip to Mattie Williams&rsquo; garage
and later to the Harrison estate. In particular she described
the mysterious woman she had followed by
bus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I plan to go back there tonight,&rdquo; she concluded.
&ldquo;For the first time since Dad disappeared, I feel I may
have stumbled into a valuable clue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems looked troubled. &ldquo;But Penny,&rdquo; she
protested, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t go to the estate alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps Louise would accompany me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two girls alone at night! I can&rsquo;t give my consent,
Penny. It&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t wish to call the police just yet, Mrs.
Weems. I&rsquo;ve no real evidence. Will you come with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper hesitated. Naturally a timid
woman, she had no desire to stir from her own fireside
that night. But she knew where her duty lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go with you, Penny,&rdquo; she consented.
&ldquo;Shall we start soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until after dark. One can&rsquo;t expect a ghost to
show up in broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost!&rdquo; Mrs. Weems quavered. &ldquo;Penny, what
are you letting me in for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know. Some strange things have
been going on at the Harrison estate. Tonight I hope
to solve part of the mystery at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pressed for an explanation, Penny repeated Mose
Johnson&rsquo;s story and told of seeing the strange white-robed
figure with her own eyes. The tale did not
add to Mrs. Weems&rsquo; comfort of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re crazy to go out there,&rdquo; the housekeeper
protested. &ldquo;Must we do it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it may be our one hope of gaining a clue
which will lead to Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m willing to risk it,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Weems.
&ldquo;However, we&rsquo;ll drive out in a taxi. And I shall personally
select the driver&mdash;a man to be depended on in
an emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So excited was the housekeeper that she had difficulty
in preparing the evening meal. In the end
Penny took over, shooing her out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare I don&rsquo;t know why I am so nervous,&rdquo; Mrs.
Weems shivered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t felt so shaky since the
time I attended a seance at Osandra&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw ghosts a-plenty on that occasion,&rdquo; smiled
Penny. &ldquo;I only hope we have as much luck tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock everything was in readiness for the
journey into the country. Dressing warmly and carrying
an extra blanket, Penny and Mrs. Weems
walked to a nearby cab station. There the housekeeper
selected a driver, a burly man who looked as
if he might have been an ex-prizefighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said as Mrs. Weems questioned
him, &ldquo;you can depend on me to look after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you at capturing ghosts?&rdquo; inquired
Penny, climbing into the cab.</p>
<p>The driver looked a trifle startled. &ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; he
rejoined. &ldquo;Bring on your spook, and if he don&rsquo;t
weigh no more than two hundred pounds, I&rsquo;ll nail
him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Penny and Mrs. Weems were satisfied that they
were in good hands. They instructed the man, Joe
Henkell, to drive directly to the old Harrison estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, do you know who owns the property?&rdquo;
Penny asked as the cab rolled toward the
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow from the East,&rdquo; Joe flung over his shoulder.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Think his name is Deming&mdash;George
Allan Deming. Wealthy sportsman. Has his
own plane an&rsquo; everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t tell you. The estate has been closed up
this winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab soon approached the familiar grounds.
Penny directed the driver to pull up some distance
from the dark house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch off the headlights,&rdquo; she instructed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
wait here. It may be a long time too, so make yourself
comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe, taking Penny at her word, began to smoke a
vile-smelling cigar which nearly drove Mrs. Weems to
distraction. After an hour had elapsed, the housekeeper
scarcely could endure the stuffy air of the cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, must we wait any longer?&rdquo; she asked
plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s early, Mrs. Weems. I expect to stay
until midnight at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight!&rdquo; The housekeeper quietly collapsed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Just then the cab driver turned around, touching
Penny&rsquo;s arm. He directed her attention to the house
by saying briefly: &ldquo;A light just went on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and Mrs. Weems focused their attention on
the upper floor of the estate. A single light could be
seen burning there, but as they watched it blinked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if a ghost is to appear this is the time!&rdquo; announced
Penny. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we get closer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang from the cab. Mrs. Weems and the
taxi driver followed with less enthusiasm. The
housekeeper, quivering and shaking, clutched the
man&rsquo;s arm as she struggled against the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, you stay right beside me!&rdquo; she ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said soothingly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get
away if I had a mind to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny, a step ahead, held up her hand as a warning
for silence. She had seen the familiar white figure
rounding a corner of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the ghost!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;See! Beyond
the gate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe whistled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spook, sure&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m alive!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you promised to nail him,&rdquo; reminded Penny,
starting forward along the fence. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll creep a little
closer. Then Joe, I shall expect you to do your
stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">15</span>
<br /><i>GHOST IN THE GARDEN</i></h2>
<p>The three investigators moved stealthily along
the high fence. Through the iron palings they could
see a white-garbed figure walking with measured tread
amid the shrubs of the frozen garden. Back and forth
the apparition strolled, following a well-trod path between
the shrunken snowdrifts.</p>
<p>Penny, Mrs. Weems, and the taxi driver crept
closer. The ghostly one did not note their approach.
Hooded head bent low, he glided to the gate, testing
chain and padlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor restless soul!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Weems.</p>
<p>Penny gave the housekeeper a tiny pinch to break
the spell which had fallen upon her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no
ghost,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see! It&rsquo;s a man
wearing a heavy white bathrobe over his clothing.
He&rsquo;s pulled the wide collar up over his head like a
hood!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man all right,&rdquo; added the taxi driver. &ldquo;You
can tell by the way he walks. Ghosts kinda slither,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s someone imprisoned on the grounds!&rdquo;
Penny whispered tensely. &ldquo;Watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost, his face shadowed, rattled the chain
again. Then with a distinct, audible sigh, he turned
and tramped back along the fence away from the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, that spook could get out if he wanted to,&rdquo;
muttered the taxi driver. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he climb over
the fence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the man is a sleep walker,&rdquo; suggested Mrs.
Weems nervously. &ldquo;Whoever he is, the poor fellow
should be in his bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was determined to learn the identity of the
man. Moving to the gate, she called softly. The
figure in white whirled around, looking straight toward
her.</p>
<p>Penny caught a fleeting impression of a lean, startled
face. Then the man turned and fled toward the
house. No longer could there be any doubt that he
was a man, for as he ran the legs of his woolen pajamas
showed beneath the white robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Penny called. &ldquo;Please wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghostly one hesitated, and glanced over his
shoulder. But the next moment he was gone, having
vanished through a side door into the house.</p>
<p>Penny, weak from excitement, clung to the gate.
&ldquo;Mrs. Weems!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Did you see him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you frightened him away when you shouted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you notice his face? As he turned toward
me, I caught a glimpse of it. Mrs. Weems, the
man looked like Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny,&rdquo; the housekeeper murmured, taking
her arm, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t be right. How could it be your
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looked like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weems firmly. &ldquo;Why, if
it had been Mr. Parker, he would have answered when
you called. He wouldn&rsquo;t have run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was compelled to acknowledge the logic of
the housekeeper&rsquo;s reasoning. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she
said reluctantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit I didn&rsquo;t see his face
plainly. I wanted it to be Dad so badly I may have
imagined the resemblance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light was switched on in an upstairs room of the
estate house. However, blinds were lowered, and
those on the ground did not obtain another glimpse of
the mysterious man who haunted the snowy garden.
Finally Mrs. Weems induced Penny to return to the
taxi.</p>
<p>Speeding toward Riverview, neither of them had
much to say. Penny could not blot from her mind
the vision of a startled, bewildered face. Reason told
her that Mrs. Weems was right&mdash;the man could not
be her father. Who then, was he? Why had he refused
to talk to her at the gate?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man may have been a sleep walker,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;Possibly the owner of the estate, Mr.
Deming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab had reached the business section of Riverview.
Upon impulse Penny decided to stop at the
<i>Star</i> plant to make sure that everything was going
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take me long,&rdquo; she assured Mrs. Weems.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wait in the cab?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a skeleton night force was on duty at the
<i>Star</i> office. The advertising department had been
closed, and on the floor above, scrub women were
busy mopping up. A sleepy-eyed desk man greeted
Penny as she entered the deserted newsroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s Okay,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;The final
edition&rsquo;s out, and most of the boys have gone home.
I was just taking a little cat nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not about your father. The police have been
kept busy chasing down false rumors. About four
hours ago a report came in your father had been seen
in Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a fake report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Penny weakly. &ldquo;No word from
Jerry, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deskman shook his head. &ldquo;Plenty of mail for
you though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anything important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly replies to that reward offer you made. A
lot of &rsquo;em are screwball letters. Your father&rsquo;s been
seen in every section of the city from the river to the
Heights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dumped it on your father&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it home to read,&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;By going
through every letter carefully I may stumble upon a
clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed the newsroom and opened the door of
her father&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The light was not on. Groping for the wall switch,
her keen ears detected stealthy steps moving away
from her. Sensing the presence of someone in the
room she called sharply: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply. Across the room, a door softly
opened and clicked shut. Penny was startled. Although
the private office had two entrances, one leading
directly into the hall, the latter had not been used
in years. Usually the door was locked and a clothes
tree stood in front of it.</p>
<p>Her groping fingers found the switch and she
flooded the room with light. A glance revealed that
mail lying on the desk had been disturbed. One of
the top drawers remained open. The clothes tree had
been moved from in front of the hall door. Plainly,
someone had just fled from the room!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Darting to the corridor door, Penny jerked it open.
No one was in sight. However, at the end of the deserted
hall, she saw the elevator cage moving slowly
downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get that fellow yet!&rdquo; she thought grimly.</p>
<p>Taking the hall at a run, she plunged down the stairway
two steps at a time. Breathless but triumphant,
she reached the lower corridor just as the cage stopped
with a jerk.</p>
<p>Harley Schirr stepped out, closing the grilled door
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy meeting you here!&rdquo; said Penny, her eyes
flashing. &ldquo;What were you doing in my father&rsquo;s office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schirr regarded her coolly. Without answering, he
tried to brush past her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were looking for something in Dad&rsquo;s desk!&rdquo;
Penny accused, blocking the way. &ldquo;I know how you
got in too! Through the hall entrance. You&rsquo;re such
a professional snooper you probably have a skeleton
key that unlocks half the doors in the building!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had about enough of your insolence!&rdquo; Schirr
retorted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no law which says I can&rsquo;t come to
this plant. And speaking of law, I may sue you for
libel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be laughing in a few days, Miss Parker!
Oh, no! I&rsquo;ve hired a lawyer, and we&rsquo;re preparing our
case. You&rsquo;ve insulted me, humiliated me in the eyes
of my fellow newspapermen, but you&rsquo;ll have to pay.
And pay handsomely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threat failed to disturb Penny. Schirr, determined
to wound her deeply, went on with grim
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kid yourself you&rsquo;ll see your father again,&rdquo; he
jeered. &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t! Mr. Parker is dead and
you may as well get used to the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s eyes burned. &ldquo;You say that only to
torture me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth. If you weren&rsquo;t so blind you&rsquo;d acknowledge
it. Your father tried to run a gang of
professional tire-thieves out of this town, and they did
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem very certain of your facts, Mr. Schirr.
Perhaps you know some of the higher-ups personally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your knowledge is so complete,&rdquo; Penny said scathingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only telling you my opinion,&rdquo; Schirr growled,
now on the defensive. &ldquo;If you want to ride along in
a sweet dream that&rsquo;s Okay with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get at the truth,&rdquo; said Penny shortly.
&ldquo;Do you have one scrap of evidence that Dad has
fallen into the hands of enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Schirr hesitated, knowing well that an affirmative
answer might lead to questioning from the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any knowledge of the case,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;At least not for publication!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flashing a superior smile, he pushed past Penny,
and went out of the building.</p>

<br /><i>A DOOR IN A BOX</i></h2>
<p>Penny scarcely knew what to think of Harley
Schirr&rsquo;s actions. All her accusations were true, of
that she was sure. But she was unable to decide
whether or not he had any information about her
father&rsquo;s strange disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old snooper may be hand in glove with the
tire thieves!&rdquo; she thought bitterly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put
it past him. If I could prove anything, wouldn&rsquo;t I like
to turn him over to the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Climbing the stairs, Penny explained briefly to the
<i>Star</i> deskman what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shirr here again!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m sure
he never came through the newsroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he got into Dad&rsquo;s office by means of that old
hall door. Tomorrow I want a new lock put on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it taken care of myself,&rdquo; promised the
deskman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Reentering her father&rsquo;s office, Penny gathered up
the mail and carefully locked both doors. She then
returned to the waiting taxicab. During the ride
home she made no mention of Mr. Schirr, preferring
not to worry the housekeeper.</p>
<p>Later in Mr. Parker&rsquo;s study, she and Mrs. Weems
examined every letter written in response to the reward
offer. Not even one of them offered the slightest
promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn everything over to the police,&rdquo; Penny said
with a sigh. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll find a clue I&rsquo;ve not considered
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both she and Mrs. Weems were feeling the effects
of such a long period of strain. Meals had been irregular,
appetites poor. Penny in particular had lost
so much weight that she looked thin and sallow. Yet
somehow she managed to keep up her strength and to
face each day with hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Weems,&rdquo; she said the next morning at breakfast,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll advance me some money, I&rsquo;m going on
another taxi jaunt today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to the Harrison place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, out to Mattie Williams&rsquo; garage. I&rsquo;m convinced
that place is dealing in stolen tires. If only I
can reconstruct the evidence which disappeared in
Dad&rsquo;s portfolio, I may get a clue that will lead to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without protest, Mrs. Weems gave Penny the
money. Secretly she thought that the girl would do
much better to turn all of her information over to the
police. However, she realized that Penny needed activity
to keep her from brooding, so she wisely did not
discourage her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get into any trouble,&rdquo; she warned anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that, Mrs. Weems. I&rsquo;ve not enough
pep for it these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Engaging the same cabman who had served her so
well the previous night, Penny motored to the Williams&rsquo;
garage. She had made no plans and scarcely
knew what she would say when she entered the place.
As she debated, the big doors of the building opened,
and a tow car drove away with Mattie at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes!&rdquo; thought Penny, disappointed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my interview will have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Getting out, she sauntered into the garage office.
Mattie&rsquo;s partner, Sam, was nowhere to be seen. Nor
did he appear to be working in the main part of the
building.</p>
<p>Penny waited a few minutes, then wandered about
the floor where a number of cars had been stored. No
workmen were in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This might be a good time to do a bit of looking
around!&rdquo; she thought suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never have a
better chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny opened the doors into the room where she
had observed Sam Burkholder mount a new tire on the
car of a customer. One wall was stacked high with
large wooden boxes, not unlike those she and Louise
had seen delivered by the truck driver, Hank Biglow,
on the night of the blizzard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>She thumped one of the boxes with her knuckles.
It gave off a hollow, empty sound. She tried another
box with no better luck. Some of the big crates had
been opened. They contained nothing except a little
brown wrapping paper.</p>
<p>Disappointed, Penny turned away. But as she
moved toward the exit, her eyes flashed upon one of
the boxes which had escaped her attention. Boards
were loose at one end, and could be hinged back on
their nails like a door.</p>
<p>Intrigued, Penny crossed to the crate. As she pulled
on one of the boards, all swung back as a unit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s like a door!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;A door in
a box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gazed into the box and was further amazed.
It had no back wall. Instead, she saw a long, empty
tunnel formed by several crates piled one in front of
the other. And at the very end stood a real door!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this is the pay-off!&rdquo; thought Penny excitedly.</p>
<p>Pulling the boards into place behind her, she stooped
and made her way through the tunnel to the door. It
was locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cent stolen tires are stored in that room!&rdquo;
reasoned Penny. &ldquo;If only I could get in there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Her mind did not dwell long on the problem. A
moment later she was alarmed to hear a low murmur
of voices. Someone was approaching the storage
room from the main part of the garage. Unless she
wished to be trapped in the tunnel of boxes, she must
abandon the investigation!</p>
<p>Penny started hurriedly toward the opening. Before
she could get through the tunnel, the big double
doors squeaked open and she heard heavy footsteps in
the room. Peering out through a knothole in one of
the boxes, she saw Mattie Williams and her partner,
Sam. They were arguing and their voices came to her
plainly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you didn&rsquo;t look for me back quite so soon,
Sam,&rdquo; Mattie reprimanded her partner. &ldquo;When I
went off in the tow car you figured I&rsquo;d be gone a long
time. Thought it would give you a good chance to
tamper with the books!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so, Mattie. I was marking up some expenses
like I always do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been aiming to have a straight talk with you
for a long time, Sam,&rdquo; the woman resumed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why I asked you to step back here in the storage
room. No use having the customers know about our
differences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;ve got to squawk about,&rdquo; Sam
retorted. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you made more money since I
teamed up with you than you ever did before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re always afraid I&rsquo;ll cheat you out of a
penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught you in some dishonest tricks. About
those tires&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud, insistent tooting of an automobile horn
broke up the conversation. Abandoning the argument,
Mattie and Sam went to serve the impatient
customer.</p>
<p>Penny did not tarry. Crawling from the tunnel,
she glanced about for a means of escape. Fortunately,
the room had an outside exit. Making use of it, she
returned to the waiting taxi, without seeing either
Sam or Mattie again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police station, Joe,&rdquo; she instructed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you want to go?&rdquo; the cab driver inquired.
&ldquo;This road or No. 32?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drive past the old Harrison place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; grinned Joe. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll see that spook
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab bumped along the frozen road, soon coming
within view of the hillside estate. Joe slowed
down without being requested to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was tellin&rsquo; the boys about that place last night,&rdquo;
he flung over his shoulder. &ldquo;They tell me the owner
is this guy Deming. He&rsquo;s gone East for the winter.
A big, fat, bald-headed man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ghost was a thin person.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I was thinking that,&rdquo; agreed Joe. &ldquo;Maybe
Deming&rsquo;s got a sick relative or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explanation did not satisfy Penny. With
troubled eyes she gazed toward the rambling old
house which by daylight looked so deserted. No
smoke curled from the chimneys. Had it not been for
a trail of footprints along the fence, she easily could
have convinced herself that she had imagined the
events of the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who&rsquo;s that trackin&rsquo; through the fields?&rdquo; Joe
suddenly demanded.</p>
<p>Penny turned to glance in the direction that the
cabman pointed. Her heart did a little flip-flop. A
woman in a long black coat, market basket on her arm,
was hastening toward the rear door of the estate house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the cab, Joe!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The car came to a halt with a little sideways skid.
Leaping out, Penny plunged through the drifts and
was able to confront the woman at the rear gate of the
premises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; she greeted her breathlessly.</p>
<p>The woman was so startled that she nearly dropped
her market basket. Confused, she stammered a reply
and started to unlock the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, please,&rdquo; requested Penny. &ldquo;May I
come inside and talk to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s disappearance. You made an appointment
to meet me at the cemetery. Why did you run
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bold attack was not without an effect. The
woman gasped, and fumbled nervously with the key to
the padlock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about!&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you tell me everything you know regarding
my father&rsquo;s disappearance, I&rsquo;ll call the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police&mdash;&rdquo; the woman repeated, plainly
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Penny went on relentlessly, &ldquo;this is a serious
matter. It will do you no good to bluff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman gave up trying to unlock the gate.
Setting her basket down in the snow she said weakly:
&ldquo;You advertised a reward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll still be glad to pay it for worthwhile information.
What do you know about my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Well, I picked
him up in my car after the accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Penny became jubilant. &ldquo;Where is he
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. Mr. Parker asked me to take
him to Mercy Hospital. I let him off at the entrance
to the grounds. That&rsquo;s the last I saw of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father entered the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t remain to watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>The story was disappointing. If true, Mr. Parker&rsquo;s
disappearance remained as mysterious as ever. Penny
was silent a moment and then she asked the woman
why she had fled from the cemetery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I saw a police car parked behind the
bushes,&rdquo; the other answered defiantly. &ldquo;And those
detectives chased me, too! I only intended to be
helpful and maybe win a reward. Now I want nothing
to do with the case. I&rsquo;ve told you everything I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman unlocked the gate and started to enter
the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Mrs. Deming?&rdquo; Penny asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who I am is my own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the ghost is your own affair too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghost? What ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live here, yet you haven&rsquo;t learned that the
grounds are haunted?&rdquo; Penny inquired significantly.
&ldquo;Nearly every night a man in white wanders back
and forth in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it!&rdquo; the woman said
nervously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not answer any more questions
either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plainly frightened, she snapped shut the padlock of
the gate and fled into the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">17</span>
<br /><i>ADVENTURE BY MOONLIGHT</i></h2>
<p>A moment Penny stood gazing at the estate house.
She considered climbing the iron fence and trying to
gain entrance to the dwelling. Then, deciding that
nothing would be achieved by again accosting the
strange woman, she returned to the waiting taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked the cabman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still the police station,&rdquo; directed Penny, repeating
an earlier order. &ldquo;I have twice as much to report
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the cab pulled away, she noticed a movement of
curtains at the front of the estate house. Evidently
the woman who had fled, was watching.</p>
<p>Joe made a quick trip to Riverview, depositing
Penny at the doorstep of Central Station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you need me any more?&rdquo; he asked hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; said Joe, slamming the cab door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
stick around. You know, I kinda like this job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Once inside the police station, Penny inquired for
Chief Jalman. Unable to see him, she asked to speak
to the two detectives who had been assigned to her
father&rsquo;s case. Both men were away from the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not talk to Carl Burns?&rdquo; suggested the desk
sergeant. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s familiar with the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was sent to see a heavy-set man who warmed
himself by a steaming radiator. Evidently he had
spent several hours in an unheated police car for he
stamped his feet to restore circulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burns?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>The man turned, staring at her. Penny returned
the stare. She had seen the officer before and the
recollection was not entirely pleasant. He was the
same officer she had met near Mattie&rsquo;s garage on the
night of the blizzard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What may I do for you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Uncomfortably aware of the officer&rsquo;s scrutiny,
Penny began to tell of her visit to the Williams&rsquo;
garage. She stammered a bit and lost confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you saw some big boxes at the garage,&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so suspicious about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tried to explain about the tunnel of boxes
which led to a hidden storage room. Even to her own
ears the story had a fantastic sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you <i>think</i> or <i>surmise</i> doesn&rsquo;t go in this business!&rdquo;
the officer said rather rudely. &ldquo;Did you actually
see any stolen tires?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Penny admitted. &ldquo;The door
was locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to swear out a warrant charging
Mattie and her partner with dealing in stolen merchandise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d dare do that. I thought if
police would investigate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go on suspicions, Miss Parker. We act
only on sound evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter so much about the stolen
tires,&rdquo; Penny said desperately. &ldquo;I have another clue&mdash;a
really important one. I&rsquo;ve found the woman who
eluded Detectives Brandon and Fuller at the cemetery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we may get somewhere,&rdquo; replied the officer.
&ldquo;Who is the woman? Where did you see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny told everything she knew about the woman
who had taken her father to Mercy Hospital. Word
for word she repeated their recent conversation together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn this evidence over to Detective Fuller,&rdquo;
the policeman promised. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably want to
question the woman himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he does it right away,&rdquo; replied Penny.
&ldquo;She may take it into her head to skip out of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officer Burns smiled wearily. &ldquo;Just trust us to
handle the case,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We know our business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Penny left the station feeling none too satisfied. Although
she had nothing against Mr. Burns, she sensed
that he did not like her. She wondered if she could
depend on him to repeat her story as she had told it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that estate house isn&rsquo;t investigated immediately,
I&rsquo;ll do something myself!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Joe, the cabman, still waited. Signaling him, Penny
regretfully explained that she would have no further
use for his services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you change your mind and want to do
some more ghost huntin&rsquo; tonight, just give me a ring,&rdquo;
Joe grinned. &ldquo;My number&rsquo;s 20476.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny carefully wrote it down. She then walked
to the nearby <i>Star</i> building where many matters
awaited her attention. There she worked without
interruption until late afternoon, taking only enough
time to call the police station. Detective Fuller was
not available. So far as she could learn, no investigation
had been made of the Harrison estate.</p>
<p>Thoroughly annoyed, Penny tramped home to dinner.
Only a cold meal awaited her. Mrs. Weems, ill
with a headache, had set out a few dishes on the
kitchen table, and gone to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; the housekeeper insisted as Penny
questioned her anxiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just worried too
much the past few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me call Doctor Barnell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not,&rdquo; Mrs. Weems remonstrated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
all right tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Penny brewed a cup of tea and made the housekeeper
as comfortable as she could. By the time she
had eaten a snack and washed the dishes it was eight
o&rsquo;clock. Debating a long while, she went to the telephone
and summoned a cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number 20476,&rdquo; she requested.</p>
<p>Penny was zipping on her galoshes when the doorbell
rang. Without giving her time to answer it,
Louise Sidell marched into the kitchen bearing a
freshly baked lemon pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother sent this over,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I slipped
on the ice coming over and nearly had a catastrophe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully Louise deposited the pie on the kitchen
table. Cutting short Penny&rsquo;s praise of it, she inquired
alertly: &ldquo;Going somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny explained that she intended to motor to the
Harrison estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not alone?&rdquo; Louise demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to, I guess. Mrs. Weems is sick, so I
can&rsquo;t take her along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could invite me,&rdquo; Louise said eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
telephone mother to come over and stay with Mrs.
Weems while we&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrangement proved satisfactory to everyone.
Mrs. Sidell came immediately to the house, and very
shortly thereafter the girls sped away in Joe&rsquo;s taxicab.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>The night was a pleasant one, mildly cold, but with
a bright moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Park before you get to the estate,&rdquo; Penny directed
the driver. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to be seen. It might defeat
our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe drew up in a clump of trees some distance from
the Harrison grounds. He then walked with the
girls to the spiked fence. There was no sign of activity.</p>
<p>Two hours elapsed. During that time nothing unusual
occurred. No lights were visible inside the
house. Even Penny began to lose heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is getting pretty boring,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe the ghost is going to show up tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may have been observed,&rdquo; suggested Louise.
&ldquo;One can see very plainly tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another half hour had elapsed Penny was
willing to return to the cab. The three started away
from the fence. Just then they heard a door slam inside
the house. Instantly they froze against the screen
of bushes, waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the ghost!&rdquo; whispered Louise.</p>
<p>A figure had appeared in the garden beyond the
gate. But the one who walked alone was not a ghost.
Plainly he was garbed in street clothes rather than
white. Over his suit he wore a heavy overcoat. A
snap-brimmed hat was pulled low on his forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Penny could not see the man&rsquo;s face, but the silhouette
seemed strangely familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like Dad!&rdquo; she whispered, clutching
Louise&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;It is he! I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it can&rsquo;t be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny paid no heed to her chum&rsquo;s protest. Breaking
away, she ran toward the gate.</p>
<p>The man in the garden became suddenly alert. As
he heard the approaching footsteps he gazed toward
the road. Upon seeing Penny he started to retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she called frantically. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know
me, Dad? It&rsquo;s Penny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words seemed to convey nothing to the man.
He shook his head in a baffled sort of way, and walked
swiftly toward the house.</p>
<p>Penny ran on to the gate. It was locked, but she
vaulted over, landing in a heap on the other side. By
the time she had picked herself up, the man had
vanished into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; Louise cried, hurrying to the gate.</p>
<p>Penny brushed snow from her coat and did not
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man couldn&rsquo;t have been your father,&rdquo; Louise
said kindly. &ldquo;Do come back, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was Dad! I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You called to him,&rdquo; Louise argued. &ldquo;If it had been
Mr. Parker he couldn&rsquo;t have failed to recognize your
voice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was Dad,&rdquo; Penny insisted stubbornly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
being held a prisoner here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s ridiculous! Whoever that man is, he
could escape from the grounds just as easily as you
climbed the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny did not wish to believe, yet she knew her
chum was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m going to talk to him,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;Now that I am inside the grounds, I&rsquo;ll ring the doorbell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Louise and Joe on the other side of the
fence, Penny went boldly to the front door. She
knocked several times and rang the bell. There was
no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t someone answer?&rdquo; she thought impatiently.</p>
<p>At the rear of the house a door slammed. Suddenly
Louise called from the gate: &ldquo;Penny! A woman is
leaving the estate by the back way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny darted to the corner of the house. The
same woman she had met earlier that day had let herself
out the rear gate. Holding the skirts of her long
black coat, she fairly ran across the snowy fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I nab her?&rdquo; called Joe, eager for action.</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s reply was surprisingly calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let her go,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;While that woman
is away, I&rsquo;ll get into the house. I think Dad is in there
alone, and I&rsquo;m going to find him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">18</span>
<br /><i>THROUGH THE CELLAR WINDOW</i></h2>
<p>Penny returned to the front porch and rang
the doorbell many times. No one came to admit her.
She tested the door, finding it locked. Windows
above the porch level could not be raised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try the back door,&rdquo; she said, refusing to accept
defeat.</p>
<p>Louise and Joe followed her to the rear of the
dwelling, but remained on the outside of the fence.</p>
<p>As Penny had feared, the back door also was locked.
She tested eight windows. Finally she found one
which opened into the cellar. To her delight the
sash swung inward as she pushed on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I go!&rdquo; she called to Louise. &ldquo;You and Joe
stay where you are and keep watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny crawled through the narrow opening and
swung herself down to the cellar floor. She landed
with a thud beside a laundry tub. The room was
dark. Groping her way toward a stairway, she
tripped over a box and made a fearful clatter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve certainly advertised my arrival!&rdquo; she thought
ruefully.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairway Penny found a light
switch and boldly turned it on. The kitchen door
was not locked. She opened it and stepped out into
another semi-dark room.</p>
<p>A doorbell at the front of the house began to ring.
Penny was dumbfounded. Then she became annoyed,
thinking that Louise and the cab driver were
trying to get in.</p>
<p>Groping her way through the house, she unlocked
the door and flung it open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Pity Sakes!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and then her voice
trailed off.</p>
<p>A uniformed messenger boy stood on the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Botts live here?&rdquo; he asked, taking a telegram
from his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>Penny did not know what to answer. Thinking
quickly, she replied: &ldquo;This is the Deming estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The messenger boy turned the beam of his flashlight
on the telegram. &ldquo;Mrs. Lennie Botts, Stop 4, Care of
G. A. Deming,&rdquo; he read aloud. &ldquo;This is the place all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Botts isn&rsquo;t at home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a lot of trouble getting here,&rdquo; the boy
complained. &ldquo;Even had to climb over the gate. How
about signing for the telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; agreed Penny, accepting the pencil.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t think of that idea myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In return for the telegram she gave the boy a small
tip. The moment he had gone, she closed the front
door and switched on a table lamp.</p>
<p>Penny found herself in a luxuriously furnished living
room. The rug underfoot was Chinese, the furniture
solid mahogany, hand carved. However, she had
no interest in her surroundings. Rather tensely, she
examined the telegram. Dared she open it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s ten years or so of jail in my young life?&rdquo;
she cajoled herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to spend it in Sing
Sing if only I can find Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny ripped open the envelope. The message, addressed
to Mrs. Lennie Botts was terse and none too
revealing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;HAVE CHANGED PLANS. WILL RETURN
THE TWENTY-SEVENTH BY PLANE.
PLEASE HAVE EVERYTHING IN READINESS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telegram was signed by the owner of the estate,
G. A. Deming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today is the twenty-seventh of the month,&rdquo;
thought Penny. &ldquo;This message must have been several
hours delayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telegram had provided little information.
Evidently the woman who had refused to tell her
name was Mrs. Lennie Botts. Regretting that she had
opened the message, Penny tossed it carelessly on the
table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Footsteps sounded on the floor directly above.
Penny had taken no pains to be quiet. Nevertheless,
her pulse quickened as she heard someone pad to the
head of the stairway. A muffled voice called: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s heart leaped for she was sure she recognized
the tones. Fairly trembling with excitement,
she darted to the foot of the circular staircase. On
the top landing in the heavy shadows stood a man
whose face she could not see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny?&rdquo; the man demanded impatiently as if the
name meant nothing to him. &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Botts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you get into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through a cellar window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so! Young lady, I don&rsquo;t know what
you&rsquo;re doing here in Mrs. Bott&rsquo;s absence. Unless you
leave at once I&rsquo;ll summon the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was not to be discouraged so easily. She
started slowly up the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo; the man ordered sharply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sick, but I&rsquo;m still a match for any house-breaker.
I have a revolver&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>So dark was the stairway that Penny could not know
whether or not the man was bluffing. His voice,
startlingly similar to her father&rsquo;s, sounded grim and
determined. Knowing that a stranger would have
good reason to treat her as a burglar, she was afraid to
venture further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep calling me Dad!&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Penny, completely baffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; the man repeated. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m Lester
Jones, a salesman. I room here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer dumbfounded Penny. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re
not being held a prisoner by Mrs. Botts?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Mrs. Botts has been very kind to
me. Especially since I&rsquo;ve been sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s perplexity increased. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen you
wandering in the garden at night,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Why do you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;oh, hang it! Do I have to explain everything
to you? My head&rsquo;s aching again. Unless you
go away and stop bothering me, I&rsquo;ll call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was completely crushed. She had been so
sure that the man was her father! Seemingly she had
made a very stupid mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>Retreating down the stairway, she left the opened
telegram on the living-room table and switched off
the light. Then unlocking the kitchen door, she rejoined
Louise and Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you didn&rsquo;t have any luck,&rdquo; her chum commented,
observing her downcast face.</p>
<p>Penny ruefully admitted that the man who had been
seen in the garden was Lester Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he wasn&rsquo;t your father,&rdquo; Louise replied.
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t listen to reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, his voice was similar,&rdquo; Penny cut in.
&ldquo;Why, the man even used one of Dad&rsquo;s pet expressions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; Louise inquired curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, hang it!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the expression Dad uses
when he&rsquo;s irritated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise helped her chum over the back fence and
guided her toward the parked taxi. Midway there
Penny paused to stare up at the dark windows of the
second floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lou!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;That man must have been
Dad even if he didn&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Penny, don&rsquo;t start that all over again,&rdquo; Louise
pleaded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only torturing yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t let you, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise held her chum&rsquo;s arm firmly. Joe opened the
door of the taxi and they pushed her in. Penny protested
for a moment, then submitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but we&rsquo;re going straight to the police
station!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be satisfied until
that man positively is identified as Lester Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>A few minutes later, at the police station, Detective
Fuller heard the entire story. It was the first he had
learned about Mrs. Botts, for Penny&rsquo;s earlier message
had not been delivered by Policeman Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that matter, I&rsquo;ve not seen Burns today,&rdquo; the
detective explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the estate at once and
question the woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Penny and Louise taxied to the estate, this
time trailed by a police car. Detective Fuller broke
the padlock on the gate and led the party to the front
door.</p>
<p>A light now burned in the living room. To Penny&rsquo;s
astonishment, the door was opened by Mrs. Botts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; she greeted the visitors pleasantly.</p>
<p>Detective Fuller flashed his badge. &ldquo;We want to
ask you a few questions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May we come
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With obvious reluctance the woman stepped aside,
allowing the party to enter the living room. Penny&rsquo;s
gaze roved to the center table. The telegram which
she had opened no longer was there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Botts did not offer chairs to the callers.
Glaring at Penny with undisguised dislike, she said
coldly: &ldquo;I suppose I am indebted to you for this visit.
What is it you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you have a roomer here,&rdquo; began Detective
Fuller.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A roomer?&rdquo; Mrs. Botts echoed blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a man by the name of Lester Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous! You don&rsquo;t seem to realize that this
is the Deming estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you an employee here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the housekeeper. During Mr. Deming&rsquo;s absence
I look after the property. I assure you no one
but myself lives in the house at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No roomer ever has stayed here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Botts drew herself up proudly. &ldquo;Would Mr.
Deming be likely to annoy himself with roomers? He
has a very substantial fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might try to pick up a few dollars yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Deming would not hear of such a thing! He
pays me well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detective Fuller asked additional questions, trying
to learn whether or not the woman was the one who
had fled from the cemetery. Mrs. Botts frankly admitted
that she had taken Mr. Parker to the hospital,
but she denied ever trying to collect a ransom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say now doesn&rsquo;t agree with your original
story,&rdquo; Penny protested. &ldquo;You admitted to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admitted nothing,&rdquo; Mrs. Botts broke in indignantly.
&ldquo;I have no secrets to hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Jones is living in this house,&rdquo;
Penny said stubbornly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; mocked Mrs. Botts. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like
to search the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we would,&rdquo; said Detective Fuller.</p>
<p>Mrs. Botts remained undisturbed. Bestowing upon
Penny a look of deep contempt, she motioned toward
the stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, search the house,&rdquo; she invited with cool
assurance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you the truth. You&rsquo;ll find no
one here but myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">19</span>
<br /><i>A BAFFLING SEARCH</i></h2>
<p>In systematic, unhurried fashion, Detective
Fuller went through every room in the Deming house.
The bed chambers, nine in number, were in perfect
order. Only Mrs. Botts&rsquo; suite over the kitchen appeared
to have been used recently.</p>
<p>As the search progressed, Penny&rsquo;s bewilderment increased.
She knew that Lester Jones had been in the
house an hour earlier, yet there was no sign of him.
Personally she inspected clothes closets and bureau
drawers. Not an article could she find that ever had
belonged to her father. She did come upon a white
woolen bathrobe. Believing it to be the garment worn
by the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; she called it to Detective Fuller&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that robe belongs to my employer, Mr. Deming,&rdquo;
explained Mrs. Botts.</p>
<p>Penny indicated water stains along the hem which
suggested that the garment had been allowed to trail
in the snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I wear the robe when I go outside to
bring in the washing,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Botts. &ldquo;It is
warmer than my coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Try as she would, Penny could not trip the woman
into making any damaging admissions. Mrs. Botts had
changed her original story and would not acknowledge
that she had fled from the cemetery. Stubbornly,
she maintained that she had told everything
she knew about Mr. Parker&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took him to Mercy Hospital in my employer&rsquo;s
car,&rdquo; she repeated to Detective Fuller. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
last I saw of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what condition was Mr. Parker when you left
him?&rdquo; questioned the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed all right. Perhaps he was a bit dazed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you report to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t see the newspapers for a day,&rdquo;
Mrs. Botts replied sullenly. &ldquo;Later I read Miss Parker&rsquo;s
offer of a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you did write, requesting me to run the ad
in the <i>Star</i>!&rdquo; Penny cried triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; Mrs. Botts retorted, &ldquo;I merely
read the item.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny knew Mrs. Botts was not telling the entire
truth, but to prove it seemed an impossible matter.
Neither could she establish that a man who claimed to
be Lester Jones had been living in the house. True,
Louise and the taxi driver would support her story,
but it would only be their word against Mrs. Botts&rsquo;.
The situation had become hopelessly confusing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Detective Fuller was not entirely satisfied with the
housekeeper&rsquo;s story. &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have to take you
along to the station for questioning,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>Only then did Mrs. Botts lose her composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t take me away!&rdquo; she pleaded anxiously.
&ldquo;My employer is coming home tonight. I just received
the telegram. If I&rsquo;m not here when he arrives,
I may lose my job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually Detective Fuller had little evidence against
Mrs. Botts and doubted that he could hold her many
hours in jail. Far more might be gained by allowing
the woman her freedom and keeping watch of the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you stay here,&rdquo; he decided after a moment&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;However, you&rsquo;ll be wanted for
questioning a little later. Make no attempt to leave
the premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t try to go away,&rdquo; Mrs. Botts promised.
&ldquo;I want to cooperate with the police. All I ask is
that my employer, Mr. Deming, doesn&rsquo;t hear of this.
I&rsquo;m innocent and it&rsquo;s not right for me to lose a good
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very shortly the party bade the woman goodbye
and left the estate. Detective Fuller assigned a policeman
to keep watch of the property and then returned
to Riverview. Louise and Penny, completely bewildered,
left with their driver, Joe, debated their next
action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; the cabman inquired. &ldquo;Home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; sighed Penny. &ldquo;I never was in such
a muddle in all my life. What became of that man
I thought was Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have left the house while we were at the
police station,&rdquo; Louise declared. &ldquo;It was a surprise
finding Mrs. Botts there too! She must have returned
in a hurry after we went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Botts got rid of Lester Jones somehow,&rdquo;
Penny said with conviction. &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a slick one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Joe shifted gears, the girls observed a dark figure
approaching the estate from down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Penny instructed the cabman. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see
who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the figure emerged from the shadow
cast by a giant tree. Penny was surprised to recognize
Mose Johnson. The old colored man carried a
basket on his arm and evidently had been doing a little
late marketing at the crossroads store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mose,&rdquo; Penny greeted him as he
approached the cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evenin&rsquo;, Miss Penny,&rdquo; he beamed, pausing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;se
suah astonished to see yo&rsquo; all out dis way. Has yo&rsquo;
been lookin&rsquo; for dat ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have,&rdquo; Penny admitted ruefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
certainly had no luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Mose shifted the market basket to his other hand.
&ldquo;Dat ole ghost ain&rsquo;t been around so much lately,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;I comes by dis spot half an hour ago on
my way to de sto&rsquo; to get some victuals. Dere wasn&rsquo;t
no ghost around den either. If dere had a been I&rsquo;d
have seen him, you kin be suah o&rsquo; dat. I was mighty
skittish and ready to make mahself absent in about two
shakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t see a thing?&rdquo; inquired Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, I can&rsquo;t rightly say dat,&rdquo; Old Mose corrected.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see no ghost but I did see a taxicab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ours, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not dis one, Miss. De cab I see was a yelleh one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information interested Penny. &ldquo;Which way
was it going, Mose?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;, Miss Penny. It was standin&rsquo; right
at de gate. Den I sees two dark lookin&rsquo; white men
git out and go into de big house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Penny demanded eagerly. &ldquo;Then what
happened? Did the cab drive away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It waited &rsquo;till de two men came back, &rsquo;cept when
dey comes back dere is three of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three men?&rdquo; Penny cried, her excitement mounting.
&ldquo;What did the third man look like, Mose?
Think hard! It&rsquo;s very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mose, &ldquo;he was tall and he had something
in his hand. A funny lookin&rsquo; little satchel. I
guess you calls it a quick-case.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean a brief case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dat&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Mose grinned. &ldquo;Anyways, dey all
gits in de taxicab and off dey snorts. And dat&rsquo;s all I
sees. Dere wasn&rsquo;t no ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colored man&rsquo;s rambling information served to
confirm Penny&rsquo;s own suspicions. Mrs. Botts had lied.
A roomer known as Lester Jones had been held at the
house and later hustled away. Perhaps the man <i>was</i>
her father!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mose,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the person you saw may have
been Dad! Did it look like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, now yo&rsquo; speaks of it, dere was somethin&rsquo;
about dat man dat look like Mr. Parker,&rdquo; the colored
man agreed. &ldquo;Kinda de way he walked. I couldn&rsquo;t
see his face cause he kept it sort o&rsquo; tucked down in his
collar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, it must have been Dad!&rdquo; Penny exclaimed.
&ldquo;The brief case practically proves it! Tell
me, which way did the cab go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight down de road,&rdquo; said Mose, pointing. &ldquo;But
de car&rsquo;s been gone a long time now. If you figures
on catchin&rsquo; dose men, you all bettah be travelin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">20</span>
<br /><i>ACCUSATIONS</i></h2>
<p>Alarmed and excited by Mose Johnson&rsquo;s revelation,
Penny glanced about for the policeman who had
been assigned to watch the Deming mansion. The
officer had taken cover somewhere and was not to be
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, drive as fast as you can to the airplane spotting
station!&rdquo; she ordered the cabman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone the
police station from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the taxi bounced along over the frozen road, the
girls kept close watch for the yellow cab Mose Johnson
had mentioned. They did not expect to overtake
it. If the old colored man&rsquo;s story was accurate, the
taxi bearing Mr. Parker had left the mansion at least
a half hour earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad must have been spirited away immediately
after I talked to him!&rdquo; Penny said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
drugged or something! Otherwise he would have
known me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But according to Mose, your father must have
gone willingly with those men,&rdquo; Louise returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;re not certain the man is your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am!&rdquo; Penny insisted. &ldquo;I was almost sure of
it earlier this evening. Now I know! Oh, Lou, something
terrible has happened to Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise drew her chum into the hollow of her arm.
&ldquo;Brace up!&rdquo; she said sternly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to
cave in now, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s slumping shoulders stiffened. She brushed
away a tear. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not going to cave in!&rdquo;
she replied indignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find Dad&mdash;tonight, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enroute to the airplane spotting station, the cab
neither met nor passed any vehicle. Leaving Louise
in the taxi, Penny clattered up the tower steps and
burst into the overheated room where Salt Sommers
was making out a report. Her words fairly tumbled
over one another as she told him what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you notify police for me?&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Salt assured her, reaching for a telephone.
&ldquo;My relief&rsquo;s due in five minutes now, so I&rsquo;ll
be free to join in the search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the photographer waited impatiently for a
connection, Penny asked him if he had seen a yellow
taxi pass the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since I&rsquo;ve been on duty. The cab must have
taken another road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Salt completed the call to the Riverview Police Station
and was told that every radio-equipped cruiser in
the city would be ordered to watch for the yellow
cab. As he hung up the receiver, a low humming
sound was heard outside the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Salt. &ldquo;A plane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Distinctly they both could hear the roar of a motor
to the eastward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an unidentified ship,&rdquo; Salt declared, reaching
for another telephone. Taking down the receiver
he said tersely: &ldquo;Army Flash,&rdquo; and went on to report
the position of the passing airplane.</p>
<p>Penny had gone to the doorway. She could see the
wing lights of the passing ship. As she watched, the
lights descended in a steep glide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;The plane is landing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer darted to the platform to see for
himself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming
down at the Deming estate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Deming is due home tonight from the East,&rdquo;
Penny added. &ldquo;That must be his plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt went inside to complete his report to headquarters.
As he rejoined Penny, they saw a man
trudging along the road toward the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My relief,&rdquo; said the photographer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Gathering up his belongings, he followed Penny
to the waiting taxicab. There a brief conference was
held. The girls were in favor of searching for the
yellow taxi, but Salt pointed out that the chance of
finding it was a slim one. He proposed that they return
to the mansion and try to force information from
Mrs. Botts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detective Fuller had no luck,&rdquo; replied Penny.
&ldquo;She has one story and she sticks to it. Her one fear
is that she&rsquo;ll lose her job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this is the time to make things merry for
her!&rdquo; urged the photographer. &ldquo;If Mr. Deming just
arrived home, we&rsquo;ll toss a few firebrands around and
find out what he has to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion appealed to Penny. From the first
she had distrusted Mrs. Botts and felt that police had
been entirely too lenient with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;If Mrs. Botts
loses her job, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s no more than she deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe drove the party once more to the Deming mansion.
No policeman was in evidence near the premises.
Actually he had gone to the crossroads store to
report to his superiors the arrival of Mr. Deming&rsquo;s
airplane, but at the moment Penny assumed the man
was neglecting his duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this case ever is solved, we must do it ourselves!&rdquo;
she declared, thumping on the front door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no
mood to take any slippery answers from Mrs. Botts!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>After a long delay the door was opened by the caretaker.
Recognizing Penny and her friends, the woman
sought to lock them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Salt, pushing her firmly
aside. &ldquo;We want to see Mr. Deming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; Mrs. Botts replied nervously.
&ldquo;Please leave me alone. Go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring the plea, Penny, Louise, and the photographer
walked boldly into the living room. A fire
burned in the grate and there were fresh flowers on
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Deming?&rdquo; asked Salt in a loud voice.</p>
<p>Footsteps sounded on the circular stairway. A
portly, bald-headed man with a pleasant face came
heavily down the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did someone ask for me?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Deming?&rdquo; asked Salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. Flew in from New York about ten minutes
ago and was just changing my clothes. What may I
do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell these folks you can&rsquo;t see
them tonight, Mr. Deming,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Botts.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied the mansion owner impatiently.
&ldquo;Sit down by the fire, everyone. Tell me what
brought you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Botts began to edge toward the kitchen door.
Observing the action, Salt called sharply:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Mrs. Botts. We want to talk to you in
particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to say,&rdquo; the caretaker retorted tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Mrs. Botts,&rdquo; ordered her employer.
&ldquo;For some reason you have seemed very nervous since
I arrived home tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was upsetting to get your telegram so late,&rdquo;
Mrs. Botts mumbled, sinking down on the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Deming,&rdquo; began Penny, &ldquo;a great deal has happened
here tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intended to tell you about it myself,&rdquo; interrupted
Mrs. Botts, addressing her employer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had
a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, please,&rdquo; commanded Mr. Deming. &ldquo;Do
continue, Miss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parker,&rdquo; supplied Penny. She introduced Salt and
Louise, then resumed her story.</p>
<p>As the tale unfolded, Mr. Deming listened with increasing
amazement. Now and then he focused his
gaze upon the crestfallen Mrs. Botts, but he did not
speak until Penny had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very serious charge you have made against
my housekeeper,&rdquo; he said then. &ldquo;Mrs. Botts, what
have you to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a word of truth in it!&rdquo; the woman
cried. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve worked for you ten years, Mr.
Deming. I&rsquo;ve been a loyal, faithful servant. Why
should I deceive you by taking a stranger into the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem fantastic,&rdquo; replied the perplexed Mr.
Deming. &ldquo;Miss Parker, what proof have you that
your accusations are true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proof of my own eyesight,&rdquo; Penny said
quietly. &ldquo;For that matter, a number of persons saw
the ghost wandering about the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Botts tossed her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already explained
that part. Frequently when I go outdoors, I put on
your old white bathrobe, Mr. Deming. It&rsquo;s warmer
than my coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost happened to be a man,&rdquo; Penny said.
&ldquo;And here is something you don&rsquo;t know, Mrs. Botts.
I was in this house earlier this evening while you were
away. I talked with your mysterious roomer, and
I&rsquo;m satisfied it was my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So <i>you</i> were here!&rdquo; Mrs. Botts cried angrily.
&ldquo;Mr. Deming, this girl opened the telegram you addressed
to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did indeed,&rdquo; admitted Penny, unabashed.</p>
<p>Mr. Deming arose and walking over to the fire,
stood with his back to it. &ldquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t know
what to say,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had reason to distrust
Mrs. Botts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo; The housekeeper smiled triumphantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Penny realized that Mr. Deming was on the verge
of swinging to Mrs. Botts&rsquo; side. So far the interview
had gained nothing. She had told the entire story.
There was no further information she could add.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we may as well go,&rdquo; she said, looking
miserably at Salt.</p>
<p>Penny arose. Suddenly her eyes lighted upon a
small object lying half hidden between the cushions
of the sofa. Before Mrs. Botts realized what she was
about, she had pounced upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s spectacle case!&rdquo; she cried triumphantly.</p>
<p>Opening the lid, she held up a pair of dark horn-rimmed
glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know where the case came from,&rdquo;
Mrs. Botts stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Dad reads on the sofa at home, he often
loses his case between the cushions!&rdquo; Penny went on
excitedly. &ldquo;Mrs. Botts, you thought you were very
clever getting him away from here and removing all
the evidence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A salesman who wore glasses was here last
week&mdash;&rdquo; the housekeeper began weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t talk yourself out of this,&rdquo; Penny cut her
short, &ldquo;Mr. Deming, let me show you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reopened the lid of the case and pointed to the
initials &ldquo;A. P.&rdquo; engraved in gold letters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony Parker,&rdquo; she said impressively. &ldquo;Dad
had them stamped there because he lost the case so
many times. Does this prove my story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said Mr. Deming. Sternly he faced the
housekeeper. &ldquo;Mrs. Botts, you have deeply humiliated
me. I shall turn you over to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Botts began to weep. Stumbling across the
room, she clutched her employer&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t turn me away from here,&rdquo; she pleaded.
&ldquo;Just give me a chance and I&rsquo;ll explain everything.
Please, Mr. Deming! This time I promise to tell the
truth!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="large">21</span>
<br /><i>MRS. BOTTS&rsquo; REVELATION</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, tell your story,&rdquo; Mr. Deming bade
the housekeeper. &ldquo;What do you know about Mr.
Parker&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just like I said,&rdquo; Mrs. Botts began in an aggrieved
voice. &ldquo;I was driving not far from the railroad
station when I saw the auto accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you were driving?&rdquo; Mr. Deming interposed.
&ldquo;In whose car, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used yours, Mr. Deming. I didn&rsquo;t think you
would care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll skip that. Go on with your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I saw the accident. A coupe driven by a
young man, crowded Mr. Parker&rsquo;s car off the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purposely?&rdquo; asked Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Two men were in the car and they
were speeding. I read part of the license number
too. It was F-215 something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you give this information to the police
immediately?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Deming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to explain. I stopped my car&mdash;your
car, I mean. Mr. Parker seemed stunned so I offered
to take him to the hospital. Of course at that time
I didn&rsquo;t know who he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad didn&rsquo;t seem much hurt?&rdquo; Penny inquired
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had a few scratches, but nothing serious. We
started for the hospital. Before we got there Mr.
Parker changed his mind and decided he didn&rsquo;t want
to go. He asked me to take him to a hotel or a rooming
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; exclaimed Penny. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
he ask to go home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he didn&rsquo;t remember he had a home,&rdquo; Mrs.
Botts replied. &ldquo;I guess the accident must have stunned
him. Anyway, he said his name was Lester Jones.
Since he wanted a room and was willing to pay, I
figured I could bring him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you turned my home into a hotel,&rdquo; Mr. Deming
remarked rather grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think you would be back this winter.
I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it, Mr. Deming, only I needed
extra money. My sister in Kansas has been sick and
I&rsquo;ve had to send her funds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Botts, I&rsquo;ve always paid you well,&rdquo; her
employer responded. &ldquo;Had you told me you needed
more money, I would have assisted you. But go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I brought Mr. Parker here and gave him a
room. Right off I noticed how queer he acted. He
didn&rsquo;t seem to be sure who he was, and he kept
going through some papers he carried in a portfolio,
trying to puzzle things out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this while you made no attempt to contact
police?&rdquo; Mr. Deming questioned severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering what to do when I saw a picture
of Mr. Parker in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you dropped an unsigned letter in my
mailbox?&rdquo; Penny probed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Botts knew that the net was closing tightly
about her. Although she tried to slant her story in
such a way that she would not appear too much at
fault, the facts remained bald and ugly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I left a note at your house,&rdquo; she acknowledged
reluctantly. &ldquo;Later I telephoned and made an appointment
to meet you at the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go through with it?&rdquo; asked Penny.
&ldquo;Were you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began to realize I might be held for something
I never intended to do. Folks started to watch this
house. I tried to keep my roomer out of sight, but
he&rsquo;d do such queer things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as stroll in the garden at night,&rdquo; supplied
Penny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I felt sorry for the poor man. He had such
dreadful headaches and was so bewildered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently you weren&rsquo;t sorry enough to tell him
who he was,&rdquo; reprimanded Mr. Deming. &ldquo;Really
Mrs. Botts, I can&rsquo;t understand why you acted as you
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just kept getting in deeper and deeper,&rdquo; the
housekeeper whined. &ldquo;Mr. Parker paid me three
dollars a day for his room and board. It didn&rsquo;t seem
wrong to take the money as long as he was satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my father now?&rdquo; Penny broke in.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the important thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Botts regarded the girl with a trace of her
former arrogance. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what became of
Mr. Parker after he left here,&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent him away when you knew Mr. Deming
was coming home!&rdquo; Penny accused. &ldquo;You thought
you could keep the truth from your employer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I would have too, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you!&rdquo;
Mrs. Botts flared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not done any harm, but
you&rsquo;ve made a lot out of it, and now I&rsquo;ll be discharged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right about that,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Deming
in a quiet voice. &ldquo;However, there&rsquo;s far more at
stake than a job, Mrs. Botts. Even now you don&rsquo;t
seem to realize the seriousness of your offense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t turn me over to the police, will you,
Mr. Deming?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be in my hands to decide your fate. I
strongly advise you to tell everything you know.
Where did Mr. Parker go when he left here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea.&rdquo; Mrs. Botts covered her face. &ldquo;Oh,
leave me alone&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask me any more questions. My
head buzzes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A taxicab with two men in it was seen at the door
earlier this evening,&rdquo; Penny went on relentlessly.
&ldquo;What have you to say about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were friends who came for Mr. Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I found the names and addresses in Mr.
Parker&rsquo;s brief case. They were men in the tire business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This latest scrap of information fairly stunned
Penny. As she well knew, her father&rsquo;s portfolio contained
only evidence pertaining to the tire-theft case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were the men?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One was named Kurt Mollinberg&mdash;Ropes Mollinberg
his friend called him. I forget the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ropes Mollinberg!&rdquo; exclaimed Salt Sommers who
had listened quietly to the story. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s one of
the lowest rats in this town! Connected with the
numbers racket and I don&rsquo;t know what else!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you summon those men, of all persons?&rdquo;
Mr. Deming questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I found their addresses in the portfolio. I
had to get rid of Mr. Parker before you came and I
was afraid to call his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cruel, heartless woman!&rdquo; accused Penny.
&ldquo;You sent my father away with two of the most notorious
rascals in Riverview. Why, those men have
been waiting for a chance to waylay him! They
wanted to get possession of vital evidence Dad had in
his portfolio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Botts. &ldquo;When
they came in the taxi, they offered me money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you took it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried not to, but they forced it on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny sprang to her feet. Only by the greatest
effort of will could she keep from telling the housekeeper
what she thought of her contemptible actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent Dad away with those men,&rdquo; she repeated
mechanically. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he realize who they were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him they were his friends. I really thought
so. He went willingly enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was sick with despair. From the first, the
situation had been grave, but now there seemed little
hope. From Mrs. Botts&rsquo; story she could only conclude
that her father suffered from a brain injury.
Even if she were fortunate enough to find him, he
would not be likely to recognize her as his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Salt,&rdquo; she pleaded, turning to the photographer.
&ldquo;What are we to do? What can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>His reply though prompt, was not completely reassuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already put every policeman in Riverview
on the trail of those men!&rdquo; he answered soberly.
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll scour every nook and cranny of this
town ourselves! Chin up, Penny! Why, we&rsquo;ve only
started to fight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">22</span>
<br /><i>A PARK BENCH</i></h2>
<p>Penny and her friends were heartsick with the
knowledge that Mr. Parker had fallen into the hands
of ruthless members of the tire-theft gang. The taxi
which had borne him away had left the mansion fully
an hour earlier. There seemed little likelihood that
the trail could be picked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone the boys at the newspaper office,&rdquo;
Salt offered. &ldquo;The police too! We&rsquo;ll put a description
on the radio. We&rsquo;ll have everybody in Riverview
watching for that yellow taxi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call the cab companies too,&rdquo; urged Penny. &ldquo;We
may be able to trace it through the driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt made good use of the Deming telephone which
had not been disconnected during the winter months.
While he phoned, Penny ran outside to find the
policeman assigned to guard the mansion. She soon
returned with him and placed Mrs. Botts in his custody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Deming, don&rsquo;t let them take me to jail,&rdquo;
the housekeeper pleaded. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do anything
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Botts, I can&rsquo;t help you,&rdquo; her employer returned
coldly. &ldquo;Your offense is a very serious one.
The court must decide your fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper broke into tears again and for several
minutes was quite hysterical. When her act
moved no one, she resigned herself to the inevitable.
Packing a few articles in a bag, she prepared to leave
the house in the custody of the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about everything,&rdquo; she said as she bade
the girls goodbye. &ldquo;I hope Mr. Parker is found. I
really do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Mrs. Botts had gone, Penny was too upset to
remain quietly in a chair. She longed to join in an
active search for the yellow taxi. Common sense
told her that the cab undoubtedly had reached its
destination, yet she hoped she might pick up a clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By questioning filling station attendants, we may
be able to learn which way it went from the crossroads,&rdquo;
she urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said Salt.</p>
<p>Joe, faithful as ever, waited in his cab outside the
mansion. Penny chose to ride beside him, as the
front seat offered an unobstructed view of the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>The cab turned away from the mansion and swept
down the familiar twisting highway. At the first
bend, the bright headlights illuminated a patch of
snow along the ditch. Penny thought she saw a small,
dark object lying on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the car!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Joe brought the cab to a standstill a little farther
down the road.</p>
<p>Penny leaped out and ran back to the ditch. Lying
just at its edge was a leather portfolio. A glance satisfied
her that it had belonged to her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt! Louise!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found Dad&rsquo;s
satchel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others came running. By that time Penny had
examined the portfolio. It was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Those men
were after the evidence Dad carried! And they got
it, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt and Joe examined the snowy ditches for a long
distance. There were no footprints. They could
only conclude that the portfolio had been thrown
from a window of the moving cab. Evidently Mr.
Parker remained a prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that those men have what they want, maybe
they&rsquo;ll release Dad,&rdquo; Penny said hopefully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you think so, Salt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The photographer glanced at Joe. Neither spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You believe they&rsquo;ll harm Dad!&rdquo; Penny cried,
reading their faces. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll never see him
again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Penny,&rdquo; Salt soothed, guiding her toward
the taxi.</p>
<p>The cab rolled on, its tires crunching the hard-packed
snow. At the crossroads, they met a police
car and hailed it. Penny turned the empty portfolio
over to one of the officers, explaining where it had
been found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every road is being watched,&rdquo; she was told in
return. &ldquo;The alarm has been broadcast throughout
the State, too. If that yellow cab still is on the road,
we&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an hour longer, Penny and her party scoured
roads in the vicinity of Riverview. Many times they
stopped at filling stations and houses to inquire if a
yellow cab had been seen to pass. Always the answer
was in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to go home?&rdquo; Salt suggested
at length. &ldquo;For all we know, police may have
found Mr. Parker by this time. We&rsquo;d never learn
about it while we&rsquo;re touring around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; agreed Penny.</p>
<p>The taxi turned toward Riverview. Arriving at
the outskirts, Joe chose a boulevard which wound
through the park. The trees, each limb and twig
glistening with ice, were very beautiful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Penny gazed absently toward the frozen lake where
a few boys were skating. Suddenly her gaze fastened
upon a man who sat on a park bench beneath a street
lamp. He wore no hat. His overcoat was unbuttoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Salt, it looks like Dad!
And it is he! It is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man on the bench had turned slightly so that
she was able to see his face.</p>
<p>Joe brought the cab to a halt with a jerk. Penny
leaped out, followed by the others. The first to
reach the bench, she fairly flung herself headlong at
the disheveled man who sat so dejectedly alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, I&rsquo;ve found you at last! How thankful
I am you&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man on the bench stared blankly at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked in a dazed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m Penny&mdash;your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no daughter,&rdquo; the man answered bitterly.
&ldquo;No home. Nothing. Not even a name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt, Louise and Joe reached the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are these people?&rdquo; the man asked. &ldquo;Why
do they stare at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Parker,&rdquo; said Salt, taking his arm. &ldquo;You
remember me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw you before in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my father&mdash;Anthony Parker,&rdquo; Penny
said desperately. &ldquo;You were in a bad accident. Don&rsquo;t
you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that I was taken by two men in a taxicab.
They pretended to be my friends. As soon as
we were well away from Mrs. Botts&rsquo; home, they
robbed me of my money and portfolio. Then they
pushed me out of the cab. I started walking. I kept
on until I came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cold and tired,&rdquo; said Salt, trying to guide
him toward the taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Mr. Parker demanded suspiciously.
&ldquo;Why should I let you take me away? You&rsquo;ll only
try to rob me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Penny murmured.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, sir,&rdquo; urged Salt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re your
friends. We&rsquo;ll take you to the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker planted his feet firmly on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going a step!&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Not a
step!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir, but if you&rsquo;re so set about it, we&rsquo;ll have
to do it this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salt nodded to Joe. Before Mr. Parker knew what
was coming, they caught him firmly by the arms and
legs. Although he resisted, they carried him to the
cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take us home as fast as you can!&rdquo; Penny directed
Joe. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll want you to go for Doctor Greer, the
brain specialist. Dad&rsquo;s in very serious condition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Serious, my eye!&rdquo; snorted the publisher. He
struggled to free himself from Salt&rsquo;s grip. &ldquo;Let me
out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, everything will be all right now,&rdquo; Penny
tried to soothe him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re with friends. You&rsquo;re
going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being kidnaped!&rdquo; Mr. Parker complained.
&ldquo;Twice in one night! If I were strong enough to get
out of here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he tried to free himself. Failing, he edged
into a corner of the seat and averted his face.</p>

<br /><i>FORGOTTEN EVENTS</i></h2>
<p>In the upstairs bedroom, Penny moved with velvet
tread. Noiselessly she rearranged a vase of flowers
and closed the slat of a Venetian blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be so quiet,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker from
the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been awake a long time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny went swiftly to his side. &ldquo;How are you
feeling this afternoon, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afternoon?&rdquo; Mr. Parker demanded, sitting up.
&ldquo;How long have I been sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roughly, about two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker threw off the covers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Penny, pressing him back
against the pillow. &ldquo;Doctor Greer says you are to
have absolute bed rest for several days. It&rsquo;s part of
the treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treatment for what?&rdquo; grumbled Mr. Parker. &ldquo;I
feel fine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; declared Penny, with a deep
sigh of relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Mrs. Weems bring up something
for you to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She called down the stairway to the housekeeper,
and then returned to the bedside. Her father looked
more like his former self than at any time since the
strange motor accident which had caused him to lose
his memory. His voice too, was more natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I must have had a bad dream,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
murmured, his gaze roving slowly about the room.
&ldquo;I seem to recall riding around in a taxi, and being
pushed out into the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where you are now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I&rsquo;m at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems came into the room bearing a tray of
food. Hearing Mr. Parker&rsquo;s words, she looked at
Penny and tears sprang to her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Greer was right,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;His
memory is slowly coming back. How thankful I
am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; Mr. Parker inquired alertly.
&ldquo;Will someone kindly tell me why I am being imprisoned
in this bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve been very, very sick,&rdquo; Penny said,
arranging the food in front of him. &ldquo;You know who
I am now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Parker indignantly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my daughter. Your name is&mdash;now let me
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Parker, in confusion.
&ldquo;Fancy forgetting my own daughter&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forgotten a number of other things too,
Dad. But events gradually are coming back to you.
Suppose you tell me your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name?&rdquo; Mr. Parker looked bewildered.
&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t remember. It&rsquo;s not Jones. I took that
name because I couldn&rsquo;t think of my own. What&rsquo;s
wrong with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny tucked a napkin beneath her father&rsquo;s chin
and offered him a spoonful of beef broth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rdquo; Mr. Parker demanded
again. &ldquo;Am I a lunatic? Can&rsquo;t either of you tell me
the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re recovering from a severe case of amnesia,&rdquo;
revealed Penny. &ldquo;The doctor says it was brought on
by overwork in combination with the shock of being
in an auto accident. Since you were hurt you&rsquo;ve not
remembered what happened before that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do recall the auto mishap,&rdquo; Mr. Parker said
slowly. &ldquo;Another car crowded me off the road. The
crash stunned me, and my mind was a sort of blank.
Then a pleasant woman took me to her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant woman, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Mrs. Botts gave me a nice room and
good food. I liked it there. But one night a girl
broke in&mdash;could that have been you, Penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Mrs. Botts came home she was very excited,&rdquo;
Mr. Parker resumed meditatively. &ldquo;She said
I had to leave. She hustled me out of the house with
two strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the men was Ropes Mollinberg, a member
of the tire-theft gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was his name!&rdquo; Mr. Parker agreed.
&ldquo;Speaking of tire thieves, I&rsquo;ve been intending to write
an editorial for the paper. Penny, please have my
secretary come in. I&rsquo;ll dictate the material while it
is fresh in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Weems looked slightly distressed. Penny,
however, whisked away the tray of food. Getting
pencil and paper she again sat down beside her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your secretary isn&rsquo;t available just now, but I&rsquo;ll
take down what you want to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny could not write shorthand so she only pretended
to jot down notes. Mr. Parker led off with
a few crisp sentences, then wandered vaguely from
one idea to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to think straight any more,&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;Type that up please and let me see it before
it goes to the compositors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I sign the editorial?&rdquo; Penny inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, with my name&mdash;Anthony Parker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Penny jumped up and fairly laughed with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, events are coming back to you! You&rsquo;ve just
recalled your name and that&rsquo;s a big step forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony Parker,&rdquo; the publisher murmured. &ldquo;Yes,
that&rsquo;s it! Now there&rsquo;s another matter that troubles
me. I had a brief case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was stolen by those men who took you away,&rdquo;
Penny supplied eagerly. &ldquo;Dad, if only you could remember
what those lost papers contained, we&rsquo;d expose
the entire tire-theft gang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker thought for a long while, then shook
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind&rsquo;s a blank, Penny. What does the doctor
say? Is there a chance my memory ever will return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; returned Penny heartily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
already recalled a number of important things. Me,
for instance! Doctor Greer thinks that with rest,
events will gradually return to mind. Or another
shock, perhaps a blow somewhat similar to the one
you had, might bring everything back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are we waiting for?&rdquo; Mr. Parker
joked. &ldquo;Go get the sledge hammer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that easy, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, either,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Parker wearily.
&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll sleep some more now. I feel pretty tired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>During the days that followed, the publisher made
a slow but steady recovery. At first Penny did not
worry him by mentioning how matters had gone at
the <i>Star</i> office. Only after Mr. Parker was well
enough to spend several hours a day at the plant, did
she reveal how Harley Schirr had sought to establish
himself as editor of the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Parker in annoyance.
&ldquo;Why, I meant to discharge him and he knew it. I
have evidence in my safe showing that Schirr accepted
money from a local politician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did have evidence,&rdquo; Penny corrected.
&ldquo;While you were away, Mr. Schirr went through
your safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazed by the boldness of his former employee,
Mr. Parker immediately examined the contents of
both his desk and strongbox. To his chagrin he found
that Penny was right. Every document pertaining to
Schirr was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; the publisher said philosophically.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never set foot in this office again,
nor in any other Riverview newspaper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; said Penny, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered if Schirr may
not be hooked up with the tire-theft gang. What do
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor thinker isn&rsquo;t much good these days.
However, I very much doubt it, Penny. Schirr always
was a snoop and not above taking money for
writing biased stories. My judgment would be that
he has no connection with the Mollinberg outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only you could remember what was in your
stolen portfolio!&rdquo; Penny sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could!&rdquo; agreed Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Sometimes
I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever fully recover my memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you will, Dad. You&rsquo;re doing better every
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny seldom spoke of the automobile accident
which had caused her father&rsquo;s trouble for the subject
was a painful one to them both. Although the publisher
had been absolved of all blame, police had not
succeeded in tracing the hit-skip driver.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker seemed well and strong. Each day he
went to the office for longer and longer periods.
Gradually his memory was returning, yet he had been
unable to recall data which might bring about the
capture of the tire-theft gang. Strangely, he could
remember nothing of his intention to call at the State
Prosecutor&rsquo;s office. Nor could he disclose a scrap of
evidence which had been carried in the stolen portfolio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Jerry would wire or return from his vacation!&rdquo;
Penny commented anxiously. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand
why he doesn&rsquo;t reply to my message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter&rsquo;s long absence had caused considerable
worry at the <i>Star</i> office. Jerry was the one person
who could divulge the contents of the stolen portfolio
documents, but repeated wires failed to bring
any response.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry will show up one of these days,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
said confidently. &ldquo;The only trouble is, by that time
the higher-ups of the tire-theft gang may have skipped
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, can&rsquo;t you remember the men who took you
away in the taxi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only vaguely. I&rsquo;ve described them to police as
best I can. So far, no action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny was silent for a moment. In her mind she
had been turning over a way to bring the crooks to
justice. It seemed to her that the men might be identified
through Black Market operators with whom they
must have dealings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what are you keeping from me?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Parker lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking about a place known as Mattie Williams&rsquo;
garage,&rdquo; replied Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve good reason to
suspect it deals in stolen tires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on to tell of her recent adventure in the
storage room of the garage. The information did
not excite Mr. Parker as she had feared it might. Instead,
it fired him with a determination to get at the
truth of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny, we&rsquo;ll break our story yet!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
reaching for his hat. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Mattie&rsquo;s place now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless we actually see the inside of the storage
room we&rsquo;ll learn nothing. You may be sure Mattie
and her partner won&rsquo;t cooperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get into that room somehow,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Parker grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take along a few pet skeleton
keys just for luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Williams&rsquo; garage an hour later, they found
Mattie and Sam busy with repair work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be with you in a minute,&rdquo; the woman called to Mr.
Parker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hurry,&rdquo; replied the publisher. &ldquo;No hurry
whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Penny wandered aimlessly about. Choosing
a moment when both Sam and Mattie were inside
the office, they slipped unnoticed into the room where
the empty boxes had been stored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now show me the tunnel,&rdquo; urged the publisher.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to work fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny swung back the hinged boards of the big
box. She led her father between a high aisle of crates
to the locked door of the inner room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if only I have a key that will unlock it!&rdquo;
muttered Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>He tried several. At length one did fit the keyhole,
the lock clicked, and he was able to push open the
door.</p>
<p>In the little storage room close to the outside building
wall were tires of all sizes and description. Some
were new, still wrapped in clean paper. Others appeared
slightly used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See, Dad!&rdquo; Penny cried triumphantly. &ldquo;I was
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still have no proof this rubber was illegally
obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny darted forward to inspect a stack of tires
which rose half way to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one that might have come off my car!&rdquo;
she cried. &ldquo;See! Mine had a tiny cut place where I
rammed the maple tree backing out of our garage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All tires look alike, Penny. Without the serial
number&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do remember part of it. One was 8910 something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this isn&rsquo;t your tire,&rdquo; replied Mr. Parker,
reading the number. &ldquo;However, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
that these are stolen tires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny held up her hand as a signal for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, Dad!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Footsteps had sounded in the tunnel between the
boxes. The next instant the door was flung open.
Penny and her father stood face to face with Sam
Burkholder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER</span>
<br /><span class="large">24</span>
<br /><i>TRICKERY</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think you&rsquo;re doing in here?&rdquo; demanded
Sam Burkholder harshly. &ldquo;Snoopers, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call us that if you like,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;How long have you been dealing in stolen tires?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shot hit its target. Sam started to speak but
no words came. He looked badly frightened. Convinced
that his suspicion was correct, Mr. Parker
added sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, I&rsquo;ll report this to the police. You and
your partner will have to face charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep Mattie out of this,&rdquo; growled Sam. &ldquo;She
had nothing to do with the tire business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you carried on crooked operations all by your
lonesome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bought and sold a few tires,&rdquo; Sam said sullenly.
&ldquo;All these government regulations give me a
pain. A guy can&rsquo;t make any money these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you admit you&rsquo;ve been doing an illegal business?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Sam, watching Mr. Parker craftily.
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s it to you? I take it you&rsquo;re not a government
agent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in breaking up a gang of leeches&mdash;the
men who&rsquo;ve been cleaning this town of tires for
the past three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those guys are crooks all right,&rdquo; agreed Sam.
&ldquo;Why the last time they sold me a bunch of tires they
charged double. When I wasn&rsquo;t going to take &rsquo;em
they said, &lsquo;Either you do, or else!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you deal with Ropes Mollinberg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just one of the little fry. What will you give
me to spill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you keep Mattie out of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; insisted Sam. &ldquo;Supposin&rsquo; I tell you how
to get the whole gang, will you forget what you&rsquo;ve
seen here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no bargains with Black Market dealers,&rdquo;
retorted Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Either you tell what you
know, or I&rsquo;ll have you and Mattie hauled into court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Burkholder was silent a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of
this business anyhow. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I know, and
it won&rsquo;t take me long. I&rsquo;ve never seen nor dealt direct
with the big shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you get your tires?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A trucker by the name of Hank Biglow delivers
them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise and I know that man!&rdquo; cried Penny. &ldquo;For
whom does he work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never asked. But from something Hank
dropped I kinda suspect the boys are having a meeting
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Mr. Parker demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you on one condition. You&rsquo;ve got to keep
Mattie out of this. So far as she knows this garage
has been run pretty much on the square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker was unwilling to make any sort of
agreement with the man. Nevertheless, he realized
that Sam had it within his power to withhold vital
information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your word for it that
Mattie is innocent. Now where is the meeting to be
held?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Johnson&rsquo;s warehouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that along the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, about eight miles from here. The boys will
be loading some tires there. If you&rsquo;re willing to take
the risk, you may learn something. Meeting&rsquo;s at
seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny glanced at her wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after six now!&rdquo; she exclaimed in dismay. &ldquo;Dad,
if we are to get there in time, we&rsquo;ve got to step!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Before leaving the garage, Mr. Parker telephoned
Central Police Station. Without mentioning Sam&rsquo;s
name, he revealed a little of what he had learned and
requested an immediate investigation of the Johnson
Warehouse. Then, intending to meet officers there,
he and Penny taxied along the winding river road.</p>
<p>Although not yet seven o&rsquo;clock, it was darkening
fast. The driver switched on headlights, illuminating
a long stretch of icy pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go faster?&rdquo; Mr. Parker urged impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare, sir,&rdquo; replied the driver.</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, a crossroads traffic light flashed
red. Though the driver applied the foot brake with
quick stabs, the car went into a disastrous skid. Out
of control, it slid crosswise in the narrow road. The
front wheels rolled into a deep, slippery ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just our luck!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>Several times the driver tried to back the car from
the ditch. Failing, he and Mr. Parker pushed while
Penny handled the steering wheel. The tires kept
spinning and would not grip the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; the publisher acknowledged at last.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only wasting time. We need a tow car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nearest house or filling station is at least a mile
up the road,&rdquo; volunteered Penny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re
stalled here until the police car comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>They climbed into the taxi and waited. No vehicle
of any description came by. With increasing
impatience, Mr. Parker looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly seven o&rsquo;clock now!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Either the police are waiting farther down the road,
or they&rsquo;ve taken a different route!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; Penny asked helplessly.
&ldquo;If we sit here much longer we&rsquo;ll miss catching
those men at their meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what we can do. Maybe our best bet
is to walk to the nearest filling station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny suddenly was struck with an idea. &ldquo;The
Riverview Yacht Club is closer!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but it&rsquo;s closed for the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My iceboat is still there,&rdquo; said Penny. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
not afraid to ride with me, I could get you to Johnson&rsquo;s
Warehouse in nothing flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we waiting for?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>Leaving the cab driver behind, Penny and her
father ran most of the way to the club. The <i>Icicle</i>,
covered with snow, runners frozen to the ice, remained
where it had been abandoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sail&rsquo;s here too!&rdquo; Penny declared, burrowing
in a box hidden deep in the cockpit. &ldquo;In this wind,
we&rsquo;ll go places!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you can handle the boat?&rdquo; Mr.
Parker asked anxiously. He had never ridden in the
<i>Icicle</i> and from his daughter&rsquo;s vivid descriptions, had
no great desire to do so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know I can start it going,&rdquo; Penny replied with a
quick laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll worry about stopping it when the
time comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They cleared the little boat of snow and pushed it
out on the smooth ice of the river. Penny made certain
that all the ropes were free running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you get in, Dad,&rdquo; she advised as she hoisted
the flapping sail. &ldquo;I want to be sure where you are
when the fireworks begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind filled the big sail like a balloon. Nothing
happened. The iceboat did not move an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go?&rdquo; growled Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Runners
dull?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gave the boat a hard push.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to help?&rdquo; offered her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; puffed Penny. &ldquo;When this baby
makes up its mind, it will go so fast you&rsquo;d be left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she pushed. The sail filled again and
the runners stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s moving!&rdquo; shouted Penny.</p>
<p>The <i>Icicle</i> was pulling away from her. She clung
fast, trying to scramble aboard. <a href="#front">Her feet went out
from under her and she was dragged over the ice.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Parker. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sail this
thing alone!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Penny clung desperately. Away flew a mitten.
Her scarf flapped in her face. With a supreme effort,
she pulled herself aboard, and took command of the
tiller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; Mr. Parker shouted anxiously in
her ear.</p>
<p>Penny shook her head and laughed. &ldquo;Getting
started always is quite a trick,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Sit
tight! We have a stiff breeze tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father wore no protective goggles.
The sharp wind stung their eyes even though they
kept their heads low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll we know when we get to the warehouse?&rdquo;
Mr. Parker shouted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just trust me,&rdquo; laughed Penny. &ldquo;All I worry
about is stopping this bronco when we get there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat was moving with the speed of an express
train. Penny made her decisions with lightning-like
rapidity, twice steering to avoid open stretches of
water. She was worried, but had no intention of letting
her father know.</p>
<p>The boat raced on. Then far ahead loomed the
dark outline of a building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the warehouse!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go past it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny gradually slowed the <i>Icicle</i>. Approaching
shore, she slacked the main sheet and shot up into
the wind. By using her overshoes for brakes, she
finally brought the boat to a standstill not far from
the warehouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, skipper,&rdquo; praised Mr. Parker.</p>
<p>Scrambling from the boat, they glanced anxiously
about. A dim light shone from inside the warehouse.
Not far from its side entrance stood a truck. There
were no other vehicles, no sign of the expected police
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the place?&rdquo; Penny asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the only warehouse within a mile. Queer
the police aren&rsquo;t here to meet us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The publisher waded through a shrunken snowdrift
to a side door of the building. It was not locked and
he pushed it open a crack. Far down a deserted corridor
shone a dim lantern light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t we to wait for the police?&rdquo; Penny whispered
uneasily.</p>
<p>Without answering, Mr. Parker started down the
corridor. Penny quickly overtook him, padding along
close at his side.</p>
<p>The corridor opened into a large storage room
used in years past to house river merchandise. Now
the walls were stacked high with tires.</p>
<p>On the ground floor stood a truck which several
men were loading. Two others watched the work
from a balcony overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, do you recognize any of those men?&rdquo; Penny
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we&rsquo;ve evidently come to the right place,&rdquo;
he replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>The men did not talk as they loaded the tires into
the truck. For many minutes Penny and her father
watched the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That truck soon will be pulling out,&rdquo; Penny observed.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the police come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to talk to those men,&rdquo; Mr. Parker decided.
&ldquo;You stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Penny could protest, her father stepped
boldly into the lighted room. Immediately work
ceased. Every eye focused upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker casually.</p>
<p>The remark was greeted by a suspicious silence.
Then one of the men, a red-faced fellow with a
twisted lower lip, asked: &ldquo;You lookin&rsquo; fer somebody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just passing through and noticed the light,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Parker. &ldquo;Wondered what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; growled one of the workmen.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to load tires. Now get out of
here or I&rsquo;ll bounce one on your head! We got work
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker did not lack courage. However, the
grim faces warned him that the men would not
hesitate to make their promise good. With Penny unprotected
in the corridor he could afford to take no
chances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have bothered you,&rdquo; he apologized, and
retreated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Penny waited nervously in the dark hallway.
&ldquo;Now what are we to do?&rdquo; she whispered as her
father rejoined her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll telephone again for the police. Let&rsquo;s get out
of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noiselessly they stole from the building. As they
huddled in the lee of a brick wall, a car came down
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be the police now!&rdquo; Penny murmured
hopefully.</p>
<p>The car turned in at the warehouse. A lone policeman
alighted. As he came over to the building, Penny
recognized him as Carl Burns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the rest of your men?&rdquo; Mr. Parker demanded.
&ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t expect to handle this tire
gang single handed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a bit mixed up?&rdquo; the policeman
drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mixed up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here on a routine inspection. This is a defense
plant, or didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A defense plant!&rdquo; Mr. Parker echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A warehouse for one, I should say,&rdquo; corrected the
policeman. &ldquo;Tires intended for the Wilson war plant
are earmarked and shipped out from here. A couple
of trucks are going out tonight. I&rsquo;m on the job to see
they&rsquo;re not hijacked.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Penny gazed blankly at her father. If the policeman&rsquo;s
information was correct, then they had nearly
made a serious blunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ve been tricked,&rdquo; Mr. Parker muttered.
&ldquo;We were told this place operates in the Black Market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a laugh,&rdquo; responded the policeman. &ldquo;Who
told you that yarn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t divulge my source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you sure were taken for a ride!&rdquo; the policeman
taunted. &ldquo;Mr. Parker, why not let the police
handle the crooks while you look after your newspaper
business? You&rsquo;ve not been yourself since you
were in that auto accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father resented the implication, but
wisely allowed the remark to pass without comment.
Decidedly crestfallen, they bade the policeman goodbye
and returned to the iceboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made ourselves ridiculous!&rdquo; Mr. Parker
commented bitterly as they shoved off down river.
&ldquo;Taken in by Sam Burkholder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably lied to get rid of us,&rdquo; agreed Penny.
&ldquo;By this time he&rsquo;s likely removed every tire from
Mattie&rsquo;s garage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker nodded and did not speak again. His
failure to learn the identity of the key men associated
with Ropes Mollinberg, had been a bitter disappointment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Penny handled the <i>Icicle</i> effortlessly and without
much thought. Faster and faster the little boat
traveled, its runners throwing up a powdery dust.</p>
<p>Then without warning the <i>Icicle</i> struck something
frozen in the ice. Before Penny could make a move,
the runners leaped from the surface. The boat tilted
to a sharp angle, and went over.</p>
<p>Penny felt herself sliding. Snow filled her mouth,
the sleeves of her coat. Her cap hung over one ear.
Laughing shakily, she scrambled to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Dad?&rdquo; she called anxiously.</p>
<p>Then she saw him. Mr. Parker was sprawled flat
on the ice a few yards away. He did not move. Terrified,
she ran to him and grasped his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad! Speak to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker stirred slightly. He raised a hand and
rubbed his head. Slowly he pulled himself to a sitting
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny&mdash;&rdquo; he mumbled, staring at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come to me&mdash;in a flash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has, Dad?&rdquo; Penny asked, wondering how
badly her father had been stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all the evidence I had in my portfolio!
Names! Pictures! I know every man who was mixed
up in the tire deal. Jerry gave it all to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You remember everything?&rdquo; cried Penny. &ldquo;Dad,
that&rsquo;s wonderful! It&rsquo;s just like Doctor Greer said.
You&rsquo;ve regained your memory as the result of a sudden
blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things did seem to rush back to me after I hit my
head on the ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping Penny&rsquo;s hand, Mr. Parker pulled himself
to his feet. Still giddy, he staggered and caught the
iceboat for support. Then recovering, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go back there right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the warehouse. We were tricked, but not by
Sam Burkholder! Policeman Burns is one of the men
I aim to expose!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="large">25</span>
<br /><i>FINAL EDITION</i></h2>
<p>Penny and her father had no definite plan as they
raced toward Johnson&rsquo;s warehouse in the iceboat.
Their only thought was to return and somehow prevent
the escape of the tire thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, is Harley Schirr one of the gang?&rdquo; Penny
shouted in Mr. Parker&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schirr?&rdquo; he repeated impatiently. &ldquo;Of course
not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t he want you to publish the
tire stories in the <i>Star</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Schirr&rsquo;s a natural-born coward,&rdquo; Mr. Parker
answered. &ldquo;He likes to snoop and give unasked advice.
Let&rsquo;s forget him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Icicle</i> slowed to a standstill near the warehouse.
Penny and her father leaped out and climbed the
slippery bank. Nearby they saw a loaded truck about
to pull away from the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We never can stop those men now!&rdquo; gasped
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can!&rdquo; cried her father. &ldquo;A police car is
coming, and this time it&rsquo;s no fake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, an automobile bearing the notation,
&ldquo;Police Department&rdquo; in bold letters, skidded into the
driveway. Detective Fuller was at the wheel and at
least four policemen were with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that truck!&rdquo; Mr. Parker shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let
it get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detective Fuller and four companions leaped from
the police car. As the loaded truck started off with
a roar, they blocked the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; shouted Detective Fuller.</p>
<p>When the order was ignored, he fired twice. The
bullets pierced the rear tires of the truck. Air
whistled out and the rubber slowly flattened.</p>
<p>For a few yards the truck wobbled on, then
stopped. Two detectives leaped for the cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, get out!&rdquo; ordered Detective Fuller,
covering the men.</p>
<p>The truck driver and two others slouched sullenly
out of the cab. As flashlights swept their faces, Penny
recognized one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank Biglow!&rdquo; she identified the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this man is Ham Mollinberg, a brother of
Ropes,&rdquo; said Mr. Parker, indicating a red-faced fellow
in a leather jacket. &ldquo;The man beside him is Al
Brancomb, wanted for skipping parole in California.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any others in the warehouse?&rdquo; demanded Detective
Fuller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be,&rdquo; said Penny excitedly. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Mr. Burns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Burns do you mean?&rdquo; questioned one of the
detectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Connected with your police force, unfortunately,&rdquo;
informed Mr. Parker. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I planned to consult
the Prosecutor before I spread the story on the
<i>Star&rsquo;s</i> front page. You boys have done good work in
Riverview and I didn&rsquo;t want to make the department
look bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burns, eh?&rdquo; Detective Fuller repeated. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
find out what he has to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman, however, was not to be apprehended
so easily. Four men, including Ropes Mollinberg,
were captured inside the warehouse. Burns had
left the building some minutes earlier and had returned
to Riverview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo; Detective Fuller
promised Mr. Parker. &ldquo;How about these other eggs?
Can you identify them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all members of the outfit,&rdquo; the publisher
said without hesitation. &ldquo;One of my reporters, Jerry
Livingston, spent weeks watching these men and getting
wise to their methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he can testify against them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He can if he gets back,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s in Canada and for some reason we&rsquo;ve been
unable to locate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penny and her father remained at the warehouse
until the handcuffed prisoners had been taken away.
They were jubilant over the capture. Not only
would the tire-theft gang be broken up, but the <i>Star</i>
had achieved another exclusive front-page story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best part of all is that you&rsquo;ve recovered your
memory!&rdquo; Penny declared to her father. &ldquo;After this,
you won&rsquo;t dare fuss when I tell you I&rsquo;m going ice-boating!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Parker. &ldquo;The <i>Icicle</i> is
the best pal I ever had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within an hour after Penny and her father left the
warehouse they were notified that Mr. Burns had been
taken into custody. Evidence piled up rapidly against
the policeman. As it definitely was established that
he had accepted money from Ropes Mollinberg, he
was stripped of his badge and put behind bars.</p>
<p>Police were not compelled to search the Williams&rsquo;
garage. Before they could act, Sam Burkholder came
voluntarily to Central Station, offering to make a
clean breast of his part in the Black Market dealings.
Both he and Mattie were held as witnesses against the
tire thieves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Mattie be kept in jail long?&rdquo; Penny asked her
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Apparently, Sam acted
alone in selling illegal tires. Since he&rsquo;s showing a disposition
to cooperate with police, he&rsquo;ll probably escape
with a heavy fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the tire theft case soon to come up for trial,
Penny was disturbed lest Jerry Livingston fail to return
from Canada in time to testify. For many days
she tormented herself with wild speculations. Then
one afternoon her worries were brought to an end by
the arrival of a telegram. Nothing had happened to
the young reporter. He had failed to reply to messages
only because he had been out of touch with
civilization.</p>
<p>In his wire, Jerry stated that he would return to
Riverview at once to aid in the search for the publisher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry doesn&rsquo;t know yet that you&rsquo;ve been found!&rdquo;
Penny said to her father. &ldquo;We must wire him right
away to set his mind at rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The message was sent, and within a few hours a reply
arrived, addressed to Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;COMING ANYWAY,&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;AM BRINGING
YOU A BEAR RUG TOGETHER WITH A
NICE BEAR HUG.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if pleasant surprises never would end, still another
came Penny&rsquo;s way. Police notified her that
among the tires seized at the Johnson Warehouse was
a set of five belonging to her stripped car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re much better off than I,&rdquo; Mr. Parker teased
her. &ldquo;Your car now is in running order again. Mine
will be in the garage for many a day. I&rsquo;ll have to pay
my own repair bill, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the hit-skip driver is found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he never will be,&rdquo; sighed Mr. Parker.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always believe the men who crowded me off the
road were hired by the tire-theft gang. No way to
prove it though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The car license number Mrs. Botts gave police
didn&rsquo;t seem to be accurate,&rdquo; Penny replied. &ldquo;By the
way, have you decided what you&rsquo;ll do about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Botts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so far you&rsquo;ve placed no formal charge against
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker smiled as he reached for a final edition
of the <i>Star</i>. The paper carried not only an account of
the round-up at Johnson&rsquo;s Warehouse, but a full confession
from Mrs. Botts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bear the woman no ill will,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s already
lost her position as caretaker at the Deming
estate. That&rsquo;s punishment enough as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently Mrs. Weems entered the living-room with
a glass of milk. When she tried to make the publisher
take it he complained that he no longer was an invalid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now drink your milk like a good lad,&rdquo; Penny
scolded. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re still as thin as a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>With a wry face Mr. Parker gulped down the drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not speak of ghosts,&rdquo; he pleaded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m well now, and I don&rsquo;t like to be reminded
of those disgraceful night-shirt parades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re perfectly well?&rdquo; teased
Penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. My memory is as good as it ever
was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you forgotten a rather important financial
item?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker looked puzzled. Then light broke over
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your allowance! I&rsquo;ve not paid it for a long while,
have I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; grinned Penny.
&ldquo;The old till is painfully empty. I can use a little
folding money to good advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father smiled and opened his pocketbook. &ldquo;Here
you are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go out and paint the town
red!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Penny thumbed over the little stack of &ldquo;folding
money&rdquo; she drew in her breath. Then she leaped
to her feet in youthful exuberance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad, you&rsquo;re a darling!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why, this
will buy a brush and a whole barrel of red paint!
Look out, Riverview, here I come!&rdquo;</p>
